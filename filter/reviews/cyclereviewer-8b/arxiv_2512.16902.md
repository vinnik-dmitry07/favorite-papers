### Summary

The paper presents an in-context learning setting where tokens serve as pure variables, acquiring meaning only through their interactions within each sequence. The authors investigate the computational strategies employed by transformers in this setting, where they are unable to pre-encode solutions in the embeddings of the words. They identify three primary algorithmic strategies: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation. These findings suggest that the kinds of reasoning strategies learned by transformers are dependent on the task structure, with symbolic, context-based strategies emerging when tokens carry no consistent meaning across contexts.

### Strengths

- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
- The authors present an interesting in-context learning setting where tokens serve as pure variables, acquiring meaning only through their interactions within each sequence. 
- The authors identify three primary algorithmic strategies: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation.

### Weaknesses

- The paper does not provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on in-context learning and its applications. The authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the current state of the field and how their work contributes to it. 
- The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the limitations of the proposed approach. The authors should discuss the potential limitations of their method and how they plan to address them in future work. 
- The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the potential impact of the proposed approach. The authors should discuss the potential impact of their work and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### Summary

This paper investigates the in-context learning abilities of transformers for arithmetic problems with variable tokens. The authors find that transformers can learn to solve arithmetic problems in this setting, and they identify three mechanisms that the models learn: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation. The authors also perform causal interventions to verify the learned mechanisms.

### Strengths

1. This paper investigates the in-context learning abilities of transformers for arithmetic problems with variable tokens, which is an interesting and important topic.
2. The authors identify three mechanisms that the models learn: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation, which are interesting and novel.
3. The authors also perform causal interventions to verify the learned mechanisms, which is a good way to analyze the learned mechanisms.

### Weaknesses

1. The authors only consider a single model architecture and a single training procedure, which limits the generalizability of the results. It would be better to include more model architectures and training procedures to see if the results are consistent across different settings.
2. The authors only consider a single dataset, which limits the generalizability of the results. It would be better to include more datasets to see if the results are consistent across different datasets.
3. The authors do not provide any ablation studies to see the effect of different hyperparameters on the results.

### Questions

1. How do the results change if we use different model architectures?
2. How do the results change if we use different training procedures?
3. How do the results change if we use different datasets?
4. How do the results change if we use different hyperparameters?

### Summary

This paper studies the in-context learning of transformers in the setting of algebraic reasoning. The authors propose a new in-context reasoning task where the assignment of tokens to specific algebraic elements varies from one sequence to another. They show that transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen groups. They develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and they isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers.

### Strengths

- The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses

- The experiments are only conducted on small groups. It is not clear whether the proposed mechanisms will work for larger groups.
- The proposed task is only tested on a single model architecture. It is not clear whether the proposed mechanisms will work for other model architectures.

### Questions

- How does the performance of the proposed task change with the size of the group?
- How does the proposed task perform on other model architectures?
