### Summary

The paper proposes a new RL method for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The authors identify three limitations of RL methods using only numerical feedback: performance plateaus, ineffective spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. They show that natural language feedback can help address these limitations. They propose a new RL method, Critique-GRPO, which combines numerical and natural language feedback. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from both initial responses and their refinements. The authors evaluate Critique-GRPO on eight challenging reasoning tasks and show that it outperforms existing SFT and numerical-feedback-only RL methods.

### Soundness

3 good

### Presentation

3 good

### Contribution

2 fair

### Strengths

The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors identify three limitations of RL methods using only numerical feedback and propose a new method that combines numerical and natural language feedback. The method is evaluated on eight challenging reasoning tasks and shows significant improvements over existing methods. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the method and its advantages over existing methods.

### Weaknesses

The main weakness of the paper is the limited novelty. The paper builds on existing work on RL methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and combines numerical and natural language feedback. The method is not significantly different from existing methods, and the results are not surprising. The paper also lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods. The authors compare Critique-GRPO with only a few existing methods, and the comparison is not comprehensive. The paper also lacks a discussion of the limitations of the method and potential future work.

### Questions

1. How does Critique-GRPO compare with other RL methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs? The paper only compares Critique-GRPO with a few existing methods, and the comparison is not comprehensive. The paper should compare Critique-GRPO with more existing methods and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
2. What are the limitations of Critique-GRPO? The paper does not discuss the limitations of the method. The paper should discuss the limitations of Critique-GRPO and potential future work.
3. How does Critique-GRPO perform on other reasoning tasks? The paper only evaluates Critique-GRPO on eight challenging reasoning tasks. The paper should evaluate Critique-GRPO on other reasoning tasks and compare it with existing methods.

### Summary

This paper proposes an online RL framework, Critique-GRPO, which integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for policy optimization. The authors show that plateaued RL models can successfully refine failed solutions when given natural language critiques. The proposed method is evaluated on eight reasoning tasks and shows significant improvement over the baselines.

### Summary

This paper proposes a new RL algorithm for LLMs, which leverages both numerical feedback and natural language feedback. The paper first identifies three limitations of RL algorithms using only numerical feedback: performance plateaus, ineffective spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. Then, the paper shows that natural language feedback can help address these limitations. The proposed algorithm, Critique-GRPO, can learn from both initial responses and their refinements. The paper evaluates Critique-GRPO on eight reasoning tasks and shows that it outperforms existing SFT and numerical-feedback-only RL methods.
