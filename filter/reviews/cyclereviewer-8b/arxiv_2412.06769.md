### Summary

This paper introduces a new paradigm for reasoning in continuous latent space, called Coconut, which involves feeding the last hidden state of the LLM as input embedding for the next token in the continuous space instead of decoding it into a word token. This approach allows the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve problems, rather than committing to a single deterministic path like traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The authors demonstrate that Coconut outperforms CoT on certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial search during planning, and shows a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

### Contribution

3 good

### Strengths

1. The idea of using a continuous latent space for reasoning is novel and interesting.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The experimental results show that Coconut outperforms CoT on certain logical reasoning tasks.

### Weaknesses

1. The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. For example, it is unclear how Coconut would perform on tasks that require more complex reasoning, such as multi-hop reasoning or reasoning over long chains of reasoning.
2. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the computational efficiency of Coconut compared to CoT. While the paper mentions that Coconut generates fewer tokens than CoT, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for each method.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the potential applications of Coconut. While the paper mentions that Coconut can be used for logical reasoning, it does not provide a detailed discussion of other potential applications.

### Questions

1. How does Coconut perform on tasks that require more complex reasoning, such as multi-hop reasoning or reasoning over long chains of reasoning?
2. How does Coconut compare to CoT in terms of computational efficiency?
3. What are the potential applications of Coconut beyond logical reasoning?

### Summary

The paper proposes a new method for reasoning in large language models, called Coconut, which uses a chain of continuous thoughts instead of discrete tokens. The method is evaluated on math and logical reasoning tasks, and shows improved performance compared to chain-of-thought reasoning.
