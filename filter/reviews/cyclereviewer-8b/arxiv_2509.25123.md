### Summary

The paper investigates whether reinforcement learning (RL) can teach large language models (LLMs) new skills. The authors argue that prior works have not provided a clear answer to this question due to their reliance on loose definitions of skills, ambiguous evaluation metrics, and potential contamination from pretraining data. To address these issues, the authors propose a synthetic framework for evaluating skill acquisition in LLMs. They define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function given an input string. The authors show that LLMs can learn new skills by composing existing ones during RL, and that these skills generalize to more complex problems. They also demonstrate that RL-trained models exhibit different reasoning behaviors compared to models trained with next-token prediction. The authors' findings suggest that RL can teach LLMs new skills, and that compositional reasoning is a key mechanism for skill acquisition. They also highlight the importance of proper incentivization in RL for skill learning.

### Summary

This paper proposes a new evaluation framework to study whether reinforcement learning (RL) can teach large language models (LLMs) new skills. The authors find that LLMs can acquire new skills during RL by composing existing ones, and that these skills generalize to more complex problems. The paper also shows that RL-trained models exhibit different reasoning behaviors compared to models trained with next-token prediction, and that the skills learned by LLMs during RL are transferable to other tasks.
