# Recursive Language Models

###### Abstract

We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models ( RLM s), a general inference paradigm that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs can successfully process inputs more than an order of magnitude beyond model context window limits and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of vanilla frontier LLMs and common long-context and coding scaffolds (e.g., on GPT-5 by a median across the evaluated benchmarks of 26 % 26\% against compaction, 130 % 130\% against CodeAct with sub-calls, and 13 % 13\% against Claude Code) across four diverse long-context tasks while having comparable cost. At a small scale, we post-train the first model around the RLM. Our model, RLM-Qwen3-8B , outperforms the underlying Qwen3-8B model by a median of 28 % 28\% and even approaches the quality of vanilla GPT-5 on three long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm .

## 1 Introduction

Frontier reasoning models have limited context windows and, even within their limits, tend to exhibit context rot ( Hong et al., 2025 ) , a phenomenon illustrated in Figure 1 where quality degrades steeply as prompts get longer. Though we expect context lengths to steadily rise through improvements to training, architecture, and infrastructure, we are interested in whether it is possible to scale the context size of general-purpose LLMs by orders of magnitude . This is increasingly urgent as LLMs begin to be widely adopted for long-horizon tasks, in which they must routinely process tens if not hundreds of millions of tokens.

We study this question through the lens of scaling inference-time compute. We are inspired by the way that reasoning models , another inference strategy, have become the fundamental interface to LLMs, resulting not only in empirical gains but also additional theoretical expressive power ( Merrill and Sabharwal, 2024 ) compared to vanilla Transformers. Though most inference-time methods for dealing with long context are task-specific ( Wu et al., 2021 ; Chang et al., 2024 ) , the most popular general approach is context condensation or compaction ( Khattab et al., 2021 ; Smith, 2025 ; OpenAI, 2025a ; Wu et al., 2025 ) , where context from user requests or agent trajectories is repeatedly summarized once it exceeds a length threshold. Unfortunately, compaction is rarely expressive enough for tasks that require dense access throughout the prompt. It presumes that some details that appear early in the prompt can safely be forgotten to make room for new content.

We introduce Recursive Language Models ( RLM s), a general-purpose inference paradigm for dramatically scaling the effective input and output lengths of LLMs. The key insight is that arbitrarily long user prompts should not be fed into the neural network (e.g., Transformer) directly but should instead be treated as part of the environment that the LLM is tasked to symbolically and recursively interact with . This system serves as an abstracted “language model” without context limitations.

As Figure 2 shows, an RLM exposes the same external interface as an LLM or a reasoning model: it accepts a string prompt of arbitrary structure and produces a string response. Given a prompt P P , the RLM initializes a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) programming environment in which P P is set as the value of a variable. It then offers the LLM general context about the REPL environment (e.g., the length of the string P P ), and permits it to write code that peeks into and decomposes P P , and to iteratively observe any side effects from execution. Crucially, RLMs encourage the LLM to understand, transform, and execute the input prompt by writing symbolic programs that invoke the LLM itself on as many slices of the input as necessary.

By treating the prompt itself as an external object and enabling symbolic recursion, RLMs tackle limitations of expressive power in recent work on coding agents, retrieval agents, and sub-agent delegation. In particular, prior coding agents and retrieval agents treat some designated external data source (e.g., a filesystem or a corpus of search documents) as an environment for fetching snippets. However, they can only fill up the underlying LLM’s context window with snippets before facing compaction. Similarly, prior self-delegation approaches ( Anthropic, 2025 ; Sentient AI, 2025 ; Schroeder et al., 2025 ; Sun et al., 2025 ) allow LLMs to invoke themselves as sub-agents. However, they are handicapped by the underlying LLM’s limited output lengths because they are designed to verbalize sub-calls autoregressively rather than producing them programmatically.

We evaluate RLMs using a frontier closed model (GPT-5; Singh et al. 2025 ) and a frontier open model (Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B; Qwen Team 2025b ) across four tasks with varying levels of complexity: deep research ( Chen et al., 2025 ) , information aggregation ( Bertsch et al., 2025 ) , code repository understanding ( Bai et al., 2025 ) , and a synthetic pairwise reasoning task where even frontier models fail catastrophically. We compare RLMs against direct LLM calls as well as context compaction, retrieval tool-use agents, and code-generation agents with and without sub-calls.

We find that RLMs demonstrate extremely strong performance even at the 10M+ token scale, and substantially outperform other approaches at long-context processing, in many cases by double-digit percentage gains while maintaining comparable cost. In particular, as demonstrated in Figure 1 , RLMs exhibit far less severe degradation for longer contexts and more sophisticated tasks.

Finally, at a small scale, we post-train the first natively recursive language model, demonstrating that RLMs can be improved quickly with little additional training. While a small open model (Qwen3-8B; Yang et al. 2025 ) struggles to solve long context tasks even in an RLM scaffold, our simple general-purpose training recipe uses only 1,000 samples from unrelated domains to improve its performance by a median of 28.3 % 28.3\% across the four evaluation tasks.

## 2 Recursive Language Models

Given a base neural language model ℳ \mathcal{M} with maximum context size K K , a Recursive Language Model (RLM) is an inference-time scaffold around ℳ \mathcal{M} that treats the user prompt as part of the environment without giving up the ability to densely process its content through different calls to ℳ \mathcal{M} . Given an arbitrary-length prompt string P ∈ Σ ⋆ P\in\Sigma^{\star} , an RLM interacts with a persistent external environment ℰ \mathcal{E} and returns a response string Y ∈ Σ ⋆ Y\in\Sigma^{\star} (Figure 2 ). We would like effectively unbounded input tokens ( | P | ≫ K |P|\gg K ), unbounded output tokens , and an unbounded semantic horizon , e.g. the ability to do Ω ⁡ ( | P | ) \Omega(|P|) or Ω ⁡ ( | P | 2 ) \Omega(|P|^{2}) semantic work.

Algorithm 1 describes how an RLM achieves this. Given a prompt P P , the RLM initializes a persistent REPL programming environment with a variable containing the user prompt as a string and a function for invoking a sub-RLM with a new prompt. Then, it starts the RLM loop. In the first iteration, the algorithm invokes the root neural model ℳ \mathcal{M} with only (constant-size) metadata about the user prompt, like its length, a short prefix, and how to access parts of it.

The root is instructed via prompting (Appendix C ) and/or fine-tuning (Appendix A ) to operate like an RLM: that is, to generate code that helps it understand and transform parts of its prompt P P , and to build up intermediate values and the final response into new variables, potentially by invoking the sub-RLM within loops . In Section 4 , we find that existing LLMs can be prompted to do this and that training an 8B model to be natively recursive is promising.

Each iteration of the RLM loop executes code in the REPL, updates REPL state (intermediate variables), and collects in stdout any printed text. Only (constant-size) metadata about stdout , like a short prefix and length, is appended to ℳ \mathcal{M} ’s history for the next iteration. 1 1 1 This is key: it forces ℳ \mathcal{M} to rely on variables and sub-calls to manage long strings instead of polluting its window. In principle, if we trim each turn to c c tokens, we will have at most K / c K/c root iterations, each of which can launch arbitrarily many sub-calls. This is not a fundamental limitation, e.g. one could move the root horizon itself into a variable, but we typically want to limit the iterations at any level of recursion irrespective. Once the RLM sets the variable Final inside the REPL, iteration stops and the value in Final is returned as the response.

RLMs make three simple design choices that are missing from many existing scaffolds. To highlight these, we include Algorithm 2 to illustrate a deceptively “similar” algorithm that is far less expressive. Both algorithms support some notion of sub-calls, external objects, and code execution, but they differ in terms of where the prompt and intermediate values live and where recursion occurs.

First, an RLM must give the underlying LLM ℳ \mathcal{M} a symbolic handle to the user prompt P P , so the model can manipulate it without copying text into the root context window. Instead, ineffective Algorithm 2 starts by putting the user prompt P P into the LLM context window ( hist ), inheriting the window limitations of ℳ \mathcal{M} and falling back to heuristics like context compaction. Even though the scaffold can access external data with, say, a Search action, it is bounded with respect to user input.

Second, ineffective Algorithm 2 asks ℳ \mathcal{M} to generate the output directly, via a Finish action. This may seem innocuous, but it means outputs cannot be longer than the context window of ℳ \mathcal{M} .

Third, and perhaps most importantly, an RLM requires symbolic recursion . That is, code running inside ℰ \mathcal{E} must be able to invoke ℳ \mathcal{M} on programmatically constructed transformations of P P (e.g., inside arbitrarily large loops), storing intermediate results symbolically. Though Algorithm 2 includes both a code execution action and a “sub-LLM” action separately, it is not able to invoke the sub-LLM programmatically and hence can only delegate a few explicitly verbalized tasks rather than writing short programs that can, say, loop over slices of the prompt and launch Ω ⁡ ( | P | ) \Omega(|P|) or even Ω ⁡ ( | P | 2 ) \Omega(|P|^{2}) processes to understand or transform all parts of P P .

We implement our RLM definition in Algorithm 1 as follows: we equip an LLM with a Python REPL, where all tools, including sub-LM or sub-RLM calls, are available as modules. The initial prompt is stored as a variable in the REPL. The LLM interacts in a loop until it provides a final answer, which can be from either a variable in the REPL, or from the LLM itself. The LLM can also print from the REPL, but it is truncated to prevent overflowing the context too quickly.

## 3 Scaling Long Context Tasks

We hypothesize that the effective context window ( Hsieh et al., 2024 ; Goldman et al., 2025 ; Hong et al., 2025 ) of an LLM cannot be understood independently of the specific task . That is, more “complex” problems will exhibit degradation at even shorter lengths than simpler ones. Because of this, we must characterize tasks in terms of how their complexity scales with prompt length .

For example, needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) problems generally keep ‘needles’ constant as prompt length is scaled. As a result, frontier models can now reliably solve these tasks in RULER ( Hsieh et al., 2024 ) in the 1M+ token settings but struggle at far shorter lengths on OOLONG ( Bertsch et al., 2025 ) , a task where the answer depends explicitly on almost every line in the prompt. 2 2 2 This helps explain the patterns seen in Figure 1 earlier: GPT-5 scales effectively on the S-NIAH task, where the needle size is constant despite longer prompts, but shows faster degradation at increasingly shorter context lengths on the linear -complexity OOLONG and the quadratic -complexity OOLONG-Pairs.

### 3.1 Tasks

We design our evaluation around tasks where we can vary the lengths of the prompts, so we can consider problems whose difficulties scale differently with context length.

S-NIAH . Following the single needle-in-the-haystack task in RULER ( Hsieh et al., 2024 ) , we consider a set of 50 single tasks that require finding a specific phrase or number in a large set of unrelated text. Here, the information being sought scales as O ⁡ ( 1 ) O(1) with respect to input length.

BrowseComp-Plus (1K documents) ( Chen et al., 2025 ) . A multi-hop question-answering benchmark for DeepResearch ( OpenAI, 2025b ) questions that requires reasoning over multiple different documents in an offline corpus. Following Sun et al. (2025) , we use 150 randomly sampled instances as our evaluation set; we provide 1000 1000 randomly chosen documents as input, in which the gold and evidence documents are guaranteed to exist. We report the percentage of correct answers. The answer to each task requires piecing together information from several documents, making this harder than S-NIAH despite also requiring a constant number of documents.

OOLONG ( Bertsch et al., 2025 ) . A long reasoning benchmark that requires semantically labeling and aggregating these labels to form a final answer. We focus specifically on the trec_coarse split, a set of 50 50 tasks over a dataset of questions with semantic labels. Each task requires using nearly all dataset questions, and therefore scales linearly in processing complexity relative to the input length.

OOLONG-Pairs . A modified variant of the trec_coarse split of OOLONG with 20 20 queries that specifically require aggregating pairs of chunks to construct the final answer. We report F1 scores over the answer, which is a list of entries. Each task requires using nearly all pairs of entries of the dataset, and therefore requires processing quadratically-many items relative to the input length. In Appendix D.1 , we list all queries in this benchmark.

LongBench-v2 CodeQA ( Bai et al., 2025 ) . A multi-choice code repository understanding split from LongBench-v2 that is challenging for modern frontier models. Each instance requires reasoning over a fixed number of files in a codebase to find the right answer.

### 3.2 Methods and Baselines

We compare RLMs against commonly used task-agnostic inference methods, using two modern LMs, GPT-5 with medium reasoning ( Singh et al., 2025 ) and default sampling parameters, and Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B ( Yang et al., 2025 ) using the sampling parameters described in Qwen Team (2025b) . For Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B, we compute costs based on the compute provider Fireworks ( Fireworks AI, 2025 ) . In addition to evaluating the base model on all tasks, we also evaluate the following methods and baselines:

CodeAct. We compare directly to a CodeAct ( Wang et al., 2024 ) agent that can execute code inside of a ReAct ( Yao et al., 2023 ) loop. Unlike an RLM, CodeAct does not offload the user prompt to the code environment, and instead provides it directly to the LM. We consider two variants: (1) a version following Jimenez et al. (2024) ; Chen et al. (2025) where we equip this agent with a BM25 ( Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009 ) retriever; (2) a version with a sub-call tool inside of the REPL. Compared to RLMs, this method loads the context directly into the model.

Compaction agent. Following Sun et al. (2025) ; Wu et al. (2025) ; Yu et al. (2025) , we consider an iterative agent that compacts the context as it is filled. For example, given a corpus of documents, it will iteratively accumulate the documents and summarize when full. In cases where a single document exceeds the model window, the agent will chunk the document and iteratively compact it. For the GPT-5 experiments, due to the extremely high cost of applying this strategy to millions of tokens, we use GPT-5-nano for compaction and GPT-5 to provide the final answer.

Coding agents. We compare against commonly used coding agents like OpenCode ( Anomaly, 2026 ) and Claude Code ( Anthropic, 2025 ) . We consider two variants, one where the context is offloaded to a file, and another where it is directly used as the initial prompt. Closed source agents like Claude Code are designed around a corresponding model, so we use Claude Opus 4.1 with Claude Code v2.0.0 (released around the same time as the GPT-5 model we use in our main results) for this baseline.

RLM . We implement an RLM with a Python REPL environment, which loads a module for querying a sub-LM and uses a system prompt presented in Appendix C . For the GPT-5 experiments, we use GPT-5-mini for the recursive LMs and GPT-5 for the root LM, as we found this choice to strike a good balance between the capabilities of RLMs and the cost of the recursive calls. We also evaluate several different max recursion depths allowable to the RLM, from 0-3. Max recursion depth 0 is an RLM without sub-calling capabilities. Max recursion depth 1 allows sub-calling LLMs, while max depth >1 allows sub-calling RLMs. We notate a RLM with max recursion depth N N using a model as RLM(model, depth= N N ), e.g. RLM(GPT-5, depth=2), and assume depth=1 if not stated otherwise.

Fine-tuning. To create RLM-Qwen3-8B , we fine-tune Qwen3-8B on 1,000 filtered trajectories of Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B as an RLM with Qwen3-8B sub-calls on LongBenchPro ( Chen et al., 2026 ) tasks. We use sampling parameters described in Qwen Team (2025a) , and evaluate the fine-tuned RLM-Qwen3-8B as an RLM. The key insight for training is that being an effective sub-call model is roughly similar to being a general purpose reasoning model, so we can make the training much more tractable at small scale by focusing on improving the root model’s ability to manipulate the REPL and to launch recursive calls. We provide more training details in Appendix A .

## 4 Results and Discussion

Table 1 reports our main evaluation results. We additionally explore how vanilla frontier model and RLM performance degrade as input contexts grow in Figure 1 .

Observation 1: RLMs can scale to the 10M+ token regime and can outperform base LMs and existing task-agnostic agent scaffolds on long context tasks . Across all tasks, RLMs demonstrate strong performance on prompts well beyond the effective context window of a frontier LM, outperforming base models and common long-context scaffolds by up to 2 × 2\times the performance while maintaining comparable or cheaper average token costs. Notably, RLMs scale well beyond the base models’ context window. For instance, on BrowseComp-Plus (1K), a linearly extrapolated cost for GPT-5-mini ingesting 6-11M input tokens is $ 1.50 − $ 2.75 \$1.50-\$2.75 , while RLM(GPT-5, depth=1) has an average cost of $ 0.99 \$0.99 and outperforms both the compaction and retrieval baselines by over 29 % 29\% .

Furthermore, on tasks where processing costs scale with the input context, RLMs make significant improvements over the base model, even on tasks within the model’s context window. On OOLONG, the RLM(depth=1) with GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder outperform the base model by 28.4 % 28.4\% and 33.3 % 33.3\% respectively. On OOLONG-Pairs, both GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder make little progress with F1 scores of ≤ 0.1 % \leq 0.1\% , while the RLM(depth=1) using these models achieve F1 scores of 58.0 % 58.0\% and 23.1 % 23.1\% respectively, highlighting the capability of RLMs to handle extremely information-dense tasks.

Observation 2: The REPL is necessary for handling long inputs, while the recursive sub-calling of RLMs provides strong benefits on information-dense inputs. A key characteristic of RLMs is offloading the context as a variable in an environment ℰ \mathcal{E} that the model can interact with. In particular, RLM(depth=0) and coding agents like Claude Code and OpenCode are able to scale beyond the context limit of the model and outperform other task-agnostic baselines on most long context settings. On CodeQA in particular with Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B, the no-sub-calling RLM(depth=0) is able to outperform all sub-calling variants of the RLM.

On information-dense tasks like OOLONG or OOLONG-Pairs, we observed several cases where programmatic recursive LM sub-calling is necessary. In § 5 , we see RLM(Qwen3-Coder) perform the necessary semantic transformation line-by-line through recursive sub-calls, while the ablation without sub-calls is forced to use keyword heuristics to solve these tasks. On OOLONG-Pairs in particular, the higher recursive depth variants of the RLM for GPT-5 outperform all other methods including Claude Code and OpenCode by a large margin.

Observation 3: LM performance degrades as a function of input length and problem complexity, while RLM performance scales better. The benchmarks S-NIAH, OOLONG, and OOLONG-Pairs contain a fixed number of tasks over contexts with lengths ranging from 2 13 2^{13} to 2 20 2^{20} . Each benchmark can be categorized by different processing complexity of the input context with respect to length (roughly constant, linear, and quadratic respectively). In Figure 1 , we directly compare an RLM(GPT-5, depth=1) to base GPT-5, and find that GPT-5 performance degrades significantly faster for more complex tasks, which aligns with the findings of Goldman et al. (2025) , while RLM performance degrades at a slower rate. For context lengths beyond 2 14 2^{14} , the RLM consistently outperforms GPT-5.

Furthermore, RLM costs scale proportionally to the complexity of the task, while still remaining in the same order of magnitude of cost as GPT-5 (see Figure 16 in Appendix F ). In § 5 , we explore the choices that the RLM makes that cause these differences in cost.

Observation 4: The inference cost of RLMs remains comparable to other methods, and in some cases base LM calls. On average, we find in Table 1 that the inference cost of RLMs is cheaper or comparable to most other baselines, including standard coding agents. Furthermore, in Figure 11 in Appendix F , we find that the median RLM run is cheaper than the median base model run, but more expensive on average due to outlier trajectories where the RLM struggles to find an answer.

We additionally report runtime numbers of each method in Figures 12 , 13 in Appendix F , but we note several important caveats. Unlike API costs, these numbers are heavily dependent on implementation details such as the machine used, API request latency, and the asynchrony of LM calls. In our implementation of the baselines and RLMs, all LM calls are blocking / sequential. Nevertheless, similar to costs, we observe a wide range of runtimes, especially for RLMs.

Observation 5: Beyond long-context, RLMs enable longer reasoning capabilities. In Table 2 , we report RLM performance on LongCoT-mini ( Motwani et al., 2026 ) , a challenging long reasoning benchmark where frontier models solve compositional problems containing interdependent subproblems. We compare with the best model reported in the paper, GPT-5.2, and find that RLM(GPT-5.2, depth=1) uses the REPL to outperform the base model. Furthermore, when providing explicit hints on how to decompose tasks, we find the RLM is able to reliably generate a graph of the problem, solving each node using sub-calls as it programmatically traverses the reasoning graph. It outperforms the base model on all domains and by a 69.5 % 69.5\% performance increase overall.

Observation 6: Training RLMs on one domain can improve general downstream RLM performance, as well as efficiency. Training also exhibits length generalization. Certain behaviors in RLM trajectories are common among different domains, such as probing the input and recursively sub-calling on shorter contexts. In Figure 3 (a), we find that RLM-Qwen3-8B , a Qwen3-8B model that we fine-tuned on RLM(Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B) trajectories on a small, unrelated set of tasks (LongBenchPro; Chen et al. 2026 ) considerably outperforms the base Qwen3-8B as a RLM across all tasks. Furthermore, its inference costs are much lower and more than 3 × 3\times faster (see Figure 6 in Appendix A ) due to better decision making and fewer mistakes as a RLM. Furthermore, we find that training RLMs exhibits length generalization; in Figure 3 (b), we train Qwen3-4B-Instruct-0527 as an RLM(depth=1) on MRCRv2 ( Vodrahalli et al., 2024 ) , a synthetic long-context task where the model must count and reproduce instances of a body of text in a corpus. By purely training through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) on a smaller split, we find that RLM(Qwen3-4B-Instruct-0527) is able to generalize to the longer, more difficult split.

## 5 Analyses of RLM Trajectories

RLMs exhibit interesting context and problem decomposition behavior. We discuss observable behavior in small and large LLMs as RLMs to understand how we can steer and improve their performance and efficiency through training and prompt tuning.

Observed RLM decomposition patterns. Current models as RLMs attempt to probe, then decompose a task into sub-tasks for recursive sub-calls to solve. In many cases such as on BrowseComp-Plus, the LM uses model priors to programmatically narrow the search space of sub-calls. RLMs are also able to output beyond their context window by stitching together sub-LM calls inside the REPL, which is required to solve tasks like OOLONG-Pairs. We detail particular trajectories in Appendix E .

First decomposition and errors in RLM trajectories. RLMs defer essentially unbounded-length reasoning chains to sub-LM calls. The choice of decomposition can greatly affect task performance, especially for information-dense problems. In Figure 4 (a), we ablate how sensitive RLM behavior is to in-context decomposition examples in its system prompt on OOLONG. We find that in-context RLM trajectories greatly improve both overall performance and the initial decomposition attempt made by the RLM, even if the example is unrelated to the actual task. Furthermore, while RLMs frequently recover from an initially incorrect decomposition pattern, we find that the first decomposition attempt is important for overall performance. In Figure 4 (b), we plot how many RLM(depth=1) trajectories in Table 1 contains syntax errors. We find that RLM(Qwen3-Coder) trajectories contain significantly more syntax errors, even for correct trajectories, compared to RLM(GPT-5). These errors explain why higher recursion depths for RLM(Qwen3-Coder) perform worse on average : Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B often makes syntax errors that result in failed outputs, and having sub-RLM calls propagates this issue to sub-calls. We include additional analysis for erroneous RLM behavior in Appendix F.1 .

## 6 Related Works

Long-Context LM Systems. There have primarily been two orthogonal directions for long-context management in language model systems: 1) directly changing the architecture of and retraining the base LM to handle longer contexts ( Press et al., 2022 ; Gu et al., 2022 ; Munkhdalai et al., 2024 ) , and 2) building a scaffold around the LM that implicitly handles the context – RLMs focus on the latter. One popular class of such strategies is lossy context management ( Chen et al., 2023 ) , which uses compaction or truncation to compress the input context at the cost of potentially losing fine-grained information. For example, ReSum ( Wu et al., 2025 ) adds a summarization tool to periodically compress the context of a multi-turn agent. Another class of strategies implement an explicit memory hierarchy in the agent scaffold ( Packer et al., 2024 ; Chhikara et al., 2025 ; Zhang et al., 2025 ) . RLMs differ from these works in that all context window management is implicitly handled by the LM itself.

Task Decomposition through sub-LM calls. Many LM-based agents ( Guo et al., 2024 ; Anthropic, 2025 ) use multiple, well-placed LM calls to solve a problem; however, many of these calls are placed based on human-engineered workflows. Several methods like ViperGPT ( Surís et al., 2023 ) , THREAD ( Schroeder et al., 2025 ) , ReDel ( Zhu et al., 2024 ) , Context Folding ( Sun et al., 2025 ) , and AgentFold ( Ye et al., 2025 ) have explored deferring the choice of sub-LM calls to the LM. These techniques emphasize task decomposition through recursive LM calls, but are unable to handle long context inputs beyond the length of the base LM. DisCIPL ( Grand et al., 2025 ) generates programs with sub-LM calls, but these programs are generated in a single-step and cannot recover from generation mistakes. RLMs, on the other hand, are enabled by an extremely simple intuition (i.e., placing the prompt in the external environment) to symbolically manipulate arbitrarily long strings and to iteratively refine their recursion via execution feedback from the persistent REPL.

## 7 Limitations and Future Work

While RLMs show strong performance on tasks beyond the context window limitations of existing LMs at reasonable inference costs, evaluations for more difficult and natural long-context processing tasks and the best mechanisms for implementing guardrails for RLMs both remain highly under-explored. Broadly, RLMs add a layer of complexity on top of existing LMs that may lead to unintentional side-effects like exploding sub-call costs, which we leave for future work to solve. We also note that future strategies involving asynchronous sub-calls and sandboxed REPLs can potentially significantly reduce the runtime and inference cost of RLMs, but further contribute to this complexity. We include additional limitations and negative results in Appendix B .

Lastly, we focused our experiments on evaluating RLMs using existing frontier models, but show initial evidence on a Qwen3-8B model that explicit training as a RLM provides very rapid performance improvements, even outside the training domain. We hypothesize that RLM trajectories can be viewed as a form of reasoning ( OpenAI et al., 2024 ; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025 ) , which can be trained by bootstrapping existing models ( Zelikman et al., 2022 ; Zelikman et al., 2024 ) . We hope that training native RLMs can be treated as a new axis of scale to improve LM performance on general and long-horizon tasks.

## 8 Conclusion

We introduced Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference framework for language models that offloads the input context and enables language models to recursively sub-query language models before providing an output. We explored an instantiation of this framework that offloads the context into a Python REPL environment as a variable in memory, enabling the LM to reason over its context in code and recursive LM calls, rather than purely in token space. Our results across multiple settings and models demonstrated that RLMs are an effective task-agnostic paradigm for both long-context problems and general reasoning. Building on our small fine-tuning experiments, we are excited to see future work that explicitly trains models to reason as RLMs, which could result in another axis of scale for the next generation of language model systems.

## Appendix A Additional Training Details

We trained RLM-Qwen3-8B as a small-scale exercise in training the first natively recursive language model. We hypothesized that, though acting as an RLM appears to produce sophisticated behavior due to recursion, it can be sufficient to focus on improving the root LM’s ability to interact with the programmatic representation of the prompt in the REPL and to discern when sub-calls are useful. In other words, while a typical RLM trajectory can be extremely long due to all of the sub-calls potentially launched (possibly Ω ⁡ ( | P | ) \Omega(|P|) for a prompt P P ), the leaf sub-calls are essentially general-purpose LLM requests and the major hurdle is learning to operate as the root model.

This simple insight allowed us to explore a similarly simple recipe for training. In particular, we sampled RLM trajectories from a larger language model (Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct; Qwen Team 2025b ) and, after filtering, distilled them to a smaller model (Qwen3-8B; Qwen Team 2025a ) from the same model family. We evaluated RLM(Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B) on 750 English LongBenchPro [ Chen et al., 2026 ] tasks, collecting a total of 2250 candidate trajectories.

We first remove trajectories that score exactly 0.0 on the benchmark or do not go beyond one turn, bringing it down to 1,072 candidate trajectories. We separated each root RLM turn (i.e. iteration) as a separate SFT sample consisting of an input (the full history) and output (the output the root LM gave at that step).

We then applied a filtering step to remove turns beyond the context limit of Qwen3-8B (we approximated this as 100k characters), and also applied an extra programmatic correction step to fix small template mistakes in RLM usage (e.g. outputting final answers, calling the REPL, etc.). To elaborate, we noticed that trajectories generated by Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B had noticeable mistakes in following the RLM instructions, which hurt the performance of the distilled RLM-Qwen3-8B. For example, it would often mix FINAL(answer) with FINAL(variable in REPL). We added an extra programmatic fixing step to look for common templated mistakes and patch them, leading to much better performance in the final RLM-Qwen3-8B . In total, 16% of turns incorrectly used FINAL answers, and 13% of turns incorrectly called a variable from the REPL (i.e. FINAL_VAR) as a final answer. In Figure 5 , we show pre- and post-filtering statistics for our training trajectories.

We used the prime-rl library [ Prime Intellect Team et al., 2025 ] for fine-tuning. We used a batch size of 64 for 300 training steps, training for 48 H100 hours. While this exceedingly simple training recipe was able to demonstrate substantial gains for our 8B model, we call on future work to investigate training native RLMs much more thoroughly. We expect that doing so at much larger scales in terms of model size, number and variety of examples, and number of (ideally on-policy and online) rollouts will be necessary to maximize the potential of RLMs.

Below, we provide plots for the runtime speed-up of training in Figure 6 .

MRCRv2 training. For the MRCRv2 [ Vodrahalli et al., 2024 ] training experiment, we similarly used prime-rl library [ Prime Intellect Team et al., 2025 ] , but on Prime Intellect’s host-training platform Lab . We RL trained on the 32k-64k token split with 2 needles for 150 steps with a batch size of 128 and 4 rollouts per example. We set a max output token per turn at 4096, and set the max number of RLM iterations to 20. Every 50 steps (starting from 0 0 ), we evaluated on the 512K-1M token split with 8 needles.

## Appendix B Negative Results: Things We Tried That Did Not Work.

Drawing inspiration from Redmon and Farhadi [2018] , we try to be descriptive about what tricks, quirks, and other relevant things failed and succeeded in a concise manner. Some observations are based on longer supplementary experiments, while others are based on small samples of results.

Using the exact same RLM system prompt across all models can be problematic. We originally wrote the RLM system prompt with in context examples for GPT-5, and tried to use the same system prompt for Qwen3-Coder, but found that it led to different, undesirable behavior in the trajectory. We had to add a small sentence to the RLM system prompt for Qwen3-Coder to prevent it from using too many recursive sub-calls.

Models without sufficient coding capabilities struggle as RLMs. Our instantiation of RLMs relies on the ability to reason through and deal with the context in a REPL environment. We found from small scale experiments that smaller models like Qwen3-8B [ Yang et al., 2025 ] struggled without sufficient coding abilities.

Thinking models without sufficient output tokens struggle as RLMs. In addition to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct , we also tried experimenting with Qwen3-235B-A22B as the RLM. While we found positive results across the board from the base model (e.g. on OOLONG [ Bertsch et al., 2025 ] , performance jumped from 30 % ~30\% to 38 % ~38\% ), the smaller gap compared to the evaluated models in the main experiments (Table 1 ) are due to multiple trajectories running out of output tokens while producing outputs due to thinking tokens exceeding the maximum output token length of an individual LM call.

RLMs without asynchronous LM calls are slow. We implemented all sub-LM queries naively as blocking / sequential calls, which caused our RLM experiments to be slow, especially compared to just the base model. We are confident that this can be resolved with a robust implementation.

Depending on the model, distinguishing between a final answer and a thought is brittle for RLMs. The current strategy for distinguishing between a “next turn" and a final answer for the RLM is to have it wrap its answer in FINAL() or FINAL_VAR() tags. Similar to intuition about structured outputs degrading performance, we also found the model to make strange decisions (e.g. it outputs its plan as a final answer). We added minor safeguards, but we also believe this issue should be avoided altogether in the future when models are trained as RLMs.

## Appendix C Additional Methods and Baseline Details

### C.1 Prompts for Experiments

We focus on methods that are entirely task agnostic, so we fix our prompt for each method across all tasks. For the RLM prompt, the only difference between GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder is an added line in the beginning that warns Qwen3-Coder not to use too many sub-LM calls – we found in practice that without this warning, the model will try to perform a subcall on everything, leading to thousands of LM subcalls for basic tasks. For the fine-tuned Qwen3-8B experiment, we provide a slightly different prompt due to the differences in context window size of the smaller model (from 272k in GPT-5 to 32k in Qwen3-8B). In this section, we provide the system prompt used for all methods in § 3.2 (other than the base model, which does not include a system prompt).

(1a) The system prompt for RLM(depth=1) for GPT-5: ⬇

(1b) The diff of the system prompt for RLM with REPL (Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B) , which adds a line from the prompt above for GPT-5: ⬇

(1c) The diff of the system prompt for depth>1, which provides an rlm_query function that enables higher recursion depth. ⬇

(1d) The diff of the system prompt for RLM(Qwen3-8B, depth=1) , which has a few changes from the GPT-5 prompt due to differences in context length and similar sub-calling behavior as Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B: ⬇

(2) The system prompt for RLM with REPL (no sub-calls) : ⬇

(3a) The system prompt for CodeAct with BM25 . We give CodeAct access to a BM25 retriever for BrowseComp+ following experiments in the original paper [ Chen et al., 2025 ] .: ⬇

(3b) The system prompt for CodeAct . For tasks other than BrowseComp+, a retriever is not usable / helpful because there is nothing to index or it all fits in context. We modify the prompt to remove the retriever.: ⬇

### C.2 Summary agent baseline

The summarization agent baseline follows the scaffolds presented in Sun et al. [2025] , Wu et al. [2025] , Yu et al. [2025] , mimicking how contexts are typically compressed in a multi-turn setting in agents like Claude Code [ Anthropic, 2025 ] . In an iterative fashion, the agent is given inputs until its context is full, at which point it is queried to summarize all relevant information and continue. If the agent is given a context in a single step that is larger than its model context window, it chunks up this context and performs the summarization process over these chunks.

For our GPT-5 baseline, we chose to use GPT-5-nano to perform summarization to avoid exploding costs. This explains the large discrepancy in cost in Table 1 between GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder on BrowseComp-Plus, where the summary agent using Qwen3-Coder is nearly 15 × 15\times more expensive on average. On this task in particular, we found on a smaller set of 20 20 random samples that the performance between using GPT-5 and GPT-5-nano is comparable.

### C.3 LongCoT-mini experiment.

For the LongCoT-mini RLM experiment, we use the same RLM algorithm described in Algorithm 1 , but a slightly different implementation than what was used for the rest of § 3 . Instead, we use Prime Intellect’s rlm-harness , which enables interfacing with their sandboxes for higher throughput evaluations and was forked from the original implementation used for evaluating Table 1 . The mechanism for determining final answers also differs, which is reflected in the prompt.

Why GPT-5 base does not include decomposition hints. Even when provided with decomposition hints, we find that GPT-5 cannot reasonably execute this decomposition and solve sub-problems using the standard chain-of-thought autoregressive reasoning. While performance on the MATH split improves, we generally find the model gets confused on the more programmatic tasks without a REPL-like mechanism to isolate sub-task solving.

The appended environment hint used for LongCoT-mini with decomposition hints on solving these problems is provided below: ⬇

## Appendix D Additional Benchmark Details

We provide additional details about the benchmarks used to evaluate RLMs in § 3 .

### D.1 OOLONG-Pairs Benchmark

OOLONG-Pairs consists of 20 20 synthetically generated tasks based on the ground-truth labels for the OOLONG Bertsch et al. [2025] trec_coarse split for input contexts of length in [1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. Similar to OOLONG, each question requires correctly predicting the semantic mapping for each entry.

OOLONG-Pairs ensures quadratic scaling . Many tasks that aggregate over pairs of entries can actually be solved without looking at the pairs and only looking at each entry in a linear fashion (e.g. using the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory). However, in OOLONG-Pairs, each question is created such that the model must return all pairs satisfying some properties, rather than just counting.

### D.2 Scaling Huge Document Corpora in BrowseComp+

In addition to the BrowseComp+ [ Chen et al., 2025 ] results for k = 1000 k=1000 documents in § 4 , we also include a smaller set of results on a subset of 20 20 tasks from the original 150 150 to show how performance degrades as a function of input size. In our original experiments, the base LMs were unable to handle the input contexts, so we add results to show how they degrade. We include two new baselines, namely ReAct w/ GPT-5 + BM25 (a variant of the CodeAct baseline without access to a code environment) and GPT-5 + pre-query BM25 (GPT-5 on pre-queried documents).

RLMs are able to scale well without performance degradation. RLM(GPT-5) is the only model / agent able to achieve and maintain perfect performance at the 1000 document scale, with the ablation (no recursion) able to similarly achieve 90 % 90\% performance. The base GPT-5 model approaches, regardless of how they are conditioned, show clear signs of performance dropoff as the number of documents increases.

RLM inference cost scales reasonably. The inference cost of RLMs on this setup scale log-linearly, and are reasonably bounded compared to other common strategies like ReAct + BM25. If we extrapolate the overall token costs of GPT-5 assuming it has an infinite context window, we observe that the inference cost of using RLM(GPT-5) is cheaper.

## Appendix E Additional RLM Trajectories

In this section, we provide several example trajectories to highlight characteristics of frontier models as RLMs. Many of the trajectories are too long to fit in text, so we describe each step and show specific examples when relevant.

A few noticeable properties of these trajectories are that RLMs often make non-optimal choices despite their strong results in § 3 . For example, in Example E.2 , we observed that the RLM with Qwen3-Coder carefully constructs its final answer through a mix of recursive sub-calls and code execution in the first iteration, but then discards this information and continues wasting sub-calls before not using these stored answers. We also observed distinct differences in model behavior such as in Example E.3 , where we found Qwen3-Coder make hundreds to thousands of recursive sub-calls for a single simple task, while GPT-5 makes on the order of ten. While these examples are not comprehensive, they provide useful qualitative insight into how to improve RLMs.

### E.1 RLM(GPT-5) on BrowseComp-Plus-Query_74

The total cost of this trajectory was $0.079 . In this task, the agent must find the answer to the following multi-hop query given a corpus of 1000 unique documents ( 8.3M total tokens) that contain evidence documents and negatives:

⬇

Step 1. GPT-5 (as the root LM) first decides to probe at the 1000 document list with regex queries. It has some priors about these events (as shown from its particular choice of words it looks for), but it also looks for specific keywords in the prompt like “beauty pageant” and “festival”.

Step 2. After running its regex queries, the root LM finds an interesting snippet on the chunk at index 6, so it launches a recursive LM call over this snippet to look for information relevant to the original query. The RLM is able to both store this information in a variable answer6 , as well as print this information out for the root LM to see. The sub-LM call finds the answer is likely ‘Maria Dalmacio‘ and stores this information back in the root LM’s environment.

Step 3. After checking the information above, the root LM reasons that it has enough information to answer the query. The root LM chooses to check its answer again with two additional recursive LM calls to confirm that its answer aligns with this check. Finally, the root LM returns its final answer as ‘Maria Dalmacio‘, which is the correct answer.

### E.2 RLM(Qwen3-Coder) on OOLONG-Pairs-Query_3

The total cost of this trajectory was $1.12 . In this task, the agent must output all pairs of user IDs satisfying some set of properties given a list of entries ( 32k tokens total). This is both an information dense long input as well as long output task, making it particularly challenging for current LMs.

⬇

Step 1. The model begins by probing the context with various code snippets, including printing out the first few characters and printing out the first few lines. We noticed in particular that Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B tends to output multiple code blocks in a single step unlike GPT-5, outputs code blocks in a more iterative fashion.

The model continues probing by splitting the input context by newline characters and checking roughly what the data format looks like.

From the given format, the model chooses to first semantically classify the data using sub-LM calls over smaller chunks of the input (to avoid context rot and mistakes in larger contexts) and provides a sample back to the root LM of what it observed during this process.

Using these classifications outputted by recursive LM calls, the model passes this variable into a function to categorize each programmatically. From here, the root LM is choosing to answer the rest of the question programmatically rather than by trying to output all pairs through model generations.

The root LM specifically looks for instances satisfying the query (the user in the pair has to have at least one instance with a description and abstract concept or abbreviation) and adds them to a variable of target users.

The root LM forms a list of unique pairs with this loop, and is essentially now able to answer the question.

The model has stored these pairs in a variable to be outputted at the end. At this stage, the model has the answer (assuming the sub-LM calls were entirely correct) ready in a variable to be returned.

Step 2. By this point the model has already successfully extracted the answer. Interestingly, however, as we observed frequently with Qwen3-Coder, the model will continue to repeatedly verify its answers. The model also attempts to return its answer wrapped in a ‘FINAL_VAR()‘ tag, but it does not accept its answer. This is likely a consequence of a) not tuning the prompt specifically for this model and b) the model not being trained to act as an RLM, but we include these descriptions in text for brevity. At this step, the model checks its pairs.

Step 3. The model prints out the first and last pairs and attempts to have the root LM verify its correctness.

Step 4. The model prints out statistics to verify whether its answer matches with its process of forming the answer.

Step 5. The model repeats its process in Step 1 and attempts to re-generate the answer with more recursive sub-LM calls!

Step 6 - 11. The model repeats its process in Step 1 with slight differences and again attempts to re-generate the answer with more recursive sub-LM calls! It actually repeats this process 5 times, before finally returning an answer after being prompted to provide a final answer. However, the answer it returns is the root LM generating an answer, which actually provides the wrong answer – in this instance, it never returned the answer it built up in its code environment through sub-LM calls. This is an example of a case where the RLM failed.

### E.3 RLM(Qwen3-Coder) on OOLONG-Query_212

The total cost of this trajectory was $0.38 . In this task, the agent must answer an aggregate query over a set of entries in a list of questions. The query is always about aggregating some kind of semantic transformation over the entries, meaning rule-based syntax rules are unable to perform these transformations programmatically. In this example, the RLM is answering the following question:

⬇

Step 1. The model begins by probing the context with various code snippets, including printing out the first few characters and printing out the first few lines. Like in the OOLONG-Pairs example, we noticed that Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B tends to output multiple code blocks in a single step unlike GPT-5, which outputs code blocks in a more iterative fashion.

As mentioned previously, Qwen3-Coder differs from GPT-5 in how liberal it is in its use of sub-calls. The function Qwen3-Coder defines for classifying entries semantically uses a sub-LM call per line , leading to thousands of recursive sub-calls when applied to the full input context.

Step 2. After defining and testing several functions for running the above classification question over its input context, the root LM launches a long code execution call to classify and answer the query.

Final. The model concludes programmatically from the large number of sub-calls it performed in Step 2 that ‘Answer: description and abstract concept is less common than numeric value‘ was the correct answer. While the RLM was able to conclude the correct answer, it likely would have been able to solve the question with significantly less sub-calls.

### E.4 RLM(GPT-5) on CodeQA-Query_44

The total cost of this trajectory was $0.27 . In this task, the agent must answer a question that involves understanding a large codebase. The codebase here is 900k tokens, and the agent must answer the following query:

Step 1. It is not always true that an input context can be solved by partitioning it and recursively sub-querying models over each partition, but in tasks that are not information dense, this is possible. In this case, the model chooses to break down the codebase into parts and sub-query LMs to look for clues. The model then aggregates these clues and provides a final answer as a separate sub-query.

Final. The RLM answers choice ‘1’, which is the correct answer.

## Appendix F Additional Quantitative Results

### F.1 Additional Quantitative Analysis of Main Results

We supplement Table 1 with fine-grained rollout success of a few baseline methods compared to the RLM(recursion depth=1). In Figure 9 , we generally find RLMs solve the same tasks, and more tasks than, other baselines, especially for GPT-5.

We also explore how sub-calling behavior differs between rollouts. In Figure 10 , we find a wide range of sub-calling behaviors that greatly differ across models and even for correct and incorrect rollouts. For example, GPT-5 uses significantly more sub-calls for BrowseComp-Plus than any other model. However, for OOLONG, Qwen3-Coder uses a large number of sub-calls ( 500 on average) for correct rollouts, which is significantly more than the number used by GPT-5. Furthermore, Qwen3-8B in particular tends to use more sub-calls on incorrect trajectories.

### F.2 Additional Runtime and Cost Analysis of RLMs

We supplement the cost and runtime analysis of RLMs with additional, fine-grained plots. We focus on RLMs with depth=0 (i.e. no sub-calls) and depth=1. In Figures 14 , 15 we include a histogram for the cost of each method on every task for both GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder. We generally observe long-tailed, high-variance trajectories for RLMs in both models. We plot the cost of RLM(depth=1) and baselines at quartiles in Figure 11 .

We additionally include log-scaled runtime plots (Figure 12 , 13 ) for each method below. The tail end (e.g. 95th percentile) shows extremely long runtimes, which is mainly due to sequential sub-LLM calls taking up most of the runtime. However, we observe these cases happen infrequently, and can be early-stopped with timeout logic. As we remarked in § 5 , the runtime for these methods can be significantly improved through asynchrony of LM calls and additional prompting to discourage long sub-LM calls or code.

For the scaling plot in Figure 1 , we also provide the average API cost per task.
