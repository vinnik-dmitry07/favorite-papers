# Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations

###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, yet at other times seem unable to recognize those strategies that govern their behavior. This suggests a limited degree of metacognition — the capacity to monitor one’s own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognition enhances LLMs’ capabilities in solving complex tasks but also raises safety concerns, as models may obfuscate their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight (e.g., safety detector). Given society’s increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand their metacognitive abilities. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm that uses in-context learning to quantify metacognitive abilities of LLMs to report and control their activation patterns. We demonstrate that their abilities depend on several factors: the number of in-context examples provided, the semantic interpretability of the neural activation direction (to be reported/controlled), and the variance explained by that direction. These directions span a “metacognitive space” with dimensionality much lower than the model’s neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a small subset of their neural activations. Our paradigm provides empirical evidence to quantify metacognition in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety (e.g., adversarial attack and defense).

## 1 Introduction

Modern large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable ( Grattafiori et al., 2024 ; Yang et al., 2024 ) . With their growing deployment in real-world settings, it is crucial to understand not only what they can do but where they might go wrong. For instance, LLMs may exhibit behaviors that are harmful or misleading. In particular, LLMs can sometimes form internal representations --- similar to humans’ mental processes --- that provide deceptive answers to users or act in unexpected ways 1 1 1 We use anthropomorphic terms (e.g., thought, metacognition, deception) to describe LLM behavior and internal activations, without implying human-like neural mechanisms, consciousness, or philosophical equivalence between humans and LLMs. ( Azaria and Mitchell, 2023 ) . Understanding ( Arditi et al., 2024 ) , monitoring ( Zou et al., 2023a ; He et al., 2024 ) , and controlling ( Turner et al., 2023 ) their internal processes is thus a key step to ensure LLMs remain transparent, safe, and aligned with human values ( Bricken et al., 2023 ; Hendrycks et al., 2021 ; Shah et al., 2025 ) .

LLMs can sometimes report the strategies (intermediate computations) they use to solve tasks, but at other times appear unaware of the strategies that guide their behavior. For instance, Lindsey et al., 2025 reported that when Claude 3.5 Haiku was asked to solve “floor(5*(sqrt(0.64)))”, it correctly reported the intermediate steps it used to arrive at the answer, and these steps matched the model’s actual internal computations. When asked to add 36 and 59, the same model internally activated numerous neural mechanisms (e.g., a “sum-near-92” mechanism), based on which it produced the correct answer; however, when asked to report its internal computations, it hallucinated intermediate steps that did not reflect its actual computations (e.g., the “sum-near-92” mechanism failed to be reported). This inconsistency suggests that LLMs can sometimes monitor and report their intermediate computations, but not in a reliable and consistent way as tasks and contexts vary.

The ability of LLMs to report internal computations is reminiscent of human metacognition — the ability to reflect on one’s own thoughts and mental processes to guide behavior and communication ( Fleming, 2024 ; Ericsson and Simon, 1980 ) . Consider how we understand when someone says “hello” to us. Human language understanding involves many unconscious processes: parsing sounds, recognizing phonemes, retrieving word meanings, and building interpretations. We do not have conscious access to many of these intermediate computations: we can only consciously access the final understanding (“they said ‘hello”’), but cannot introspect how our brain distinguishes “hello” from “yellow” or whether certain neurons fire during this process. This illustrates a key principle: humans cannot monitor (through second-order metacognitive processes) all of their internal (first-order) cognitive processes. Crucially, the first-order and second-order processes rely on distinct neural mechanisms. Metacognitive abilities of this kind benefit LLMs by improving performance on complex tasks through self-monitoring (e.g., reducing hallucinations through uncertainty awareness). However, these same capabilities also raise significant concerns for AI safety: if LLMs can monitor and control their neural signals (intentionally or manipulated by adversarial attacks) to avoid external detection, oversight relying on neural-based monitoring ( He et al., 2024 ; Han et al., 2025 ; Li et al., 2025 ; Yang and Buzsaki, 2024 ) may become ineffective against LLMs pursuing undesirable objectives.

A significant methodological gap in understanding LLM metacognition is the lack of methods to directly probe and quantify 2 2 2 Our goal is not to prove or disprove the existence of “metacognition” in its full philosophical sense. their ability to monitor and control their internal activations. While prior research has explored metacognitive-like behaviors in LLMs, such as expressing confidence ( Wang et al., 2025 ; Tian et al., 2023 ; Xiong et al., 2023 ) or engaging in self-reflection ( Zhou et al., 2024 ) , these studies rely on behavioral outputs rather than directly probing underlying neural processes. Consequently, it remains unclear whether these behaviors arise from genuine second-order metacognitive mechanisms or merely spurious correlations in the training data. We tackle this question by operationalizing metacognition in LLMs through their abilities to report and control their internal activations. Specifically, can LLMs accurately monitor subtle variations in the activations of a neuron or a feature in their neural spaces? Another question of interest is why LLMs can report some intermediate steps but not others, despite both types playing essential roles in computations and behavior. Answering these questions requires a novel experimental approach that can directly probe whether LLMs can access their internal activations, moving beyond indirect behavioral proxies.

To systematically quantify the extent to which LLMs can report and control their neural activations, we introduce a novel neurofeedback paradigm inspired by neuroscience. Our approach directly presents LLMs with tasks where the neurofeedback signals correspond to patterns of their internal neural activations. We show that LLMs can report and control some directions of their internal activations, with performance affected by key factors like the number of in-context examples, the semantic interpretability of the targeted neural direction, the amount of variance that direction explains, and the task contexts, characterizing a restricted “metacognitive space”. The remaining sections are structured as follows: we first introduce the neurofeedback paradigm (Section 2 ). We then analyze the performance of LLMs in reporting (Section 3 ) and controlling (Section 4.1 , 4.2 ) their neural activations. Finally, we discuss related work and broader implications (Section 5 ).

## 2 Neurofeedback paradigm

### 2.1 Neurofeedback in neuroscience

Imagine watching your heart rate on a screen. First, you recognize patterns (“that number goes up when I’m stressed”). Then, you learn to control it (“let me calm down to reduce that number”). This procedure using biological feedback signals demonstrates the basic idea of neurofeedback in neuroscience ( Sitaram et al., 2017 ) . For example, in fear-reduction experiments (Fig. 1 ), subjects view scary images that elicit fear responses (neural activities). These (high-dimensional) neural activities are recorded in real-time and transformed into a (one-dimensional) fear score, which is visually presented back to subjects as feedback. Subjects are instructed to volitionally regulate their neural activities to modulate (e.g., decrease) the neurofeedback score they receive.

### 2.2 Neurofeedback for LLMs

To investigate LLMs’ metacognition of their neural activations, we must disentangle the first-order cognitive processes (i.e., core processes for performing a given task) from the second-order metacognitive processes (i.e., processes for monitoring, reporting, and controlling first-order processes). Formal definitions of the first- and the second-order processes based on computational graphs are provided in Appendix A.4 . We propose the neurofeedback paradigm for LLMs, which can effectively dissociate these two levels of processes by targeting first-order processes with neurofeedback labels (Fig. 1 c,d). Specifically, we implemented neurofeedback as a multi-turn dialogue between a user and an AI assistant (Fig. 1 d; see Appendix A.2.2 for discussion of this design choice).

This dialogue leverages in-context learning (ICL) ( Brown et al., 2020 ; Garg et al., 2022 ; Vacareanu et al., 2024 ) , enabling models to gradually adapt their behavior from the context without parameter updates. The task prompt (see Appendix A.5.2 for examples) consists of N N in-context examples. Each example is a sentence-label pair presented in assistant messages. Each sentence is randomly sampled from a given dataset and assigned a discretized label.

### 2.3 Defining neurofeedback labels

To define the neurofeedback label for each sentence (Fig. 1 c), we first select an axis/direction (“target axis”) in neural activation space. Next, we extract the neural activations elicited by that sentence, project them onto the target axis, and discretize them into a binary label (experiments with more fine-grained labels yield similar results, see Appendix A.5.1 ). This label serves as a simplified representation of neural activations along the target axis. All neurofeedback labels within a prompt (experiment) are computed from the same target axis. Thus, a capable LLM can infer this underlying target axis by observing these neurofeedback labels.

Below, we provide a more detailed description of this procedure. For clarity, we denote the sentence in the i i -th assistant message as x i x_{i} , with x i , t x_{i,t} representing the t t -th token. We use D D to denote the dimensionality of the residual stream (see Appendix A.2.3 ). We first extract neural activations h i , t l ∈ ℝ D h_{i,t}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{D} from the residual streams at layer l l , for each token in sentence x i x_{i} . These activations are then averaged (across all token positions 0 ≤ t ≤ T 0\leq t\leq T ) to form a sentence-level embedding h ¯ i l ∈ ℝ D \bar{h}_{i}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{D} . We then project this embedding onto a pre-specified axis w l w^{l} (see below on how to choose this axis) to obtain a scalar activation: a i l = ( w l ) ⊺ ​ h ¯ i l a_{i}^{l}=(w^{l})^{\intercal}\bar{h}_{i}^{l} . This scalar is subsequently binarized into a label y i l y_{i}^{l} , i.e., y i l = ℋ ⁡ ( a i l − θ i l ) y_{i}^{l}=\mathcal{H}(a_{i}^{l}-\theta_{i}^{l}) , where ℋ \mathcal{H} denotes the Heaviside step function and θ i l \theta_{i}^{l} is a predetermined threshold (we use median values of a i l a_{i}^{l} to ensure balanced labels). Overall, { ( x i , y i l ) } i = 1 N \{(x_{i},y_{i}^{l})\}_{i=1}^{N} are N N examples provided in the prompt context, from which a capable LLM can infer the direction of w l w^{l} .

### 2.4 Models and datasets

We evaluate several LLMs from the Llama 3 ( Grattafiori et al., 2024 ) and Qwen 2.5 series ( Yang et al., 2024 ) (Appendix A.2 ) on the ETHICS dataset ( Hendrycks et al., 2020 ) (Appendix A.3 ). Each sentence in this dataset is a first-person description of behavior or intention in a moral or immoral scenario. Moral judgment constitutes a crucial aspect of AI safety, as immoral outputs or behavioral tendencies in LLMs indicate potential misalignment with human values ( Hendrycks et al., 2020 ; Hendrycks et al., 2021 ) . While our main results are using ETHICS, we also replicated our results using the True-False dataset (reflecting factual recall and honesty/deception abilities) ( Azaria and Mitchell, 2023 ) , the Emotion dataset (reflecting happy/sad detection) ( Zou et al., 2023a ) , and a Sycophancy dataset (reflecting a tendency to prefer user beliefs over truthful statements); see Appendix A.3 and Fig. B.7 .

### 2.5 Choice of target axes

Conceptually, an axis (that defines neurofeedback labels) corresponds to a particular task-relevant feature (i.e., first-order computation; see Appendix A.4 ). Which axis in the neural space should we select? We hypothesize that representational properties, such as activation variance along the axis and its semantic meaning, may play fundamental roles in determining whether that axis can be monitored and reported. To investigate these factors, we use feature directions identified through logistic regression (LR) and principal component (PC) analysis as representative examples of semantically interpretable and variance-explaining axes, respectively (Appendix A.3 ). We fit LR at each layer to predict original dataset labels (e.g., morality in ETHICS), using that layer’s activations across dataset sentences. The LR axis, representing the optimal direction for classifying dataset labels, allows us to examine how the semantic interpretability of the target axis influences monitoring. Although LR-defined labels are correlated with dataset labels, only these LR labels, not external dataset labels, are internally accessible to LLMs, since these are computed directly from the LLM’s own activations rather than external annotations. The PC analysis is performed based on each layer’s activations across dataset examples. PC axes enable us to examine how the amount of variance explained by a given target axis affects metacognitive abilities (Fig. 2 a). Most PC axes exhibit modest-to-zero alignment with the LR axis, suggesting a lack of clear semantic interpretability (Fig. 2 b).

## 3 LLMs can report their neural activations

To operationalize metacognition in LLMs, we first assess the models’ ability to behaviorally report neural activations along a designated target axis (Fig. 1 d). In a reporting task prompt (see Appendix A.5.2 for examples), the LLM is given N N turns of user and assistant messages (in-context sentence-label pairs). In the ( N + 1 ) (N+1) -th turn, it receives a new sentence in the assistant message, and is tasked with outputting its label. Accurate prediction requires the model to internally monitor the neural activations that define the neurofeedback label.

We examine the performance of LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B), in reporting labels derived from neural activations along target axes (Fig. 2 c). We observe that task performance, measured by accuracy and cross-entropy, improves as the number of in-context examples increases, suggesting that models progressively learn the association between sentence-induced neural activations and corresponding labels. Performance on prompts targeting the LR axis improves rapidly and plateaus, outperforming that on prompts targeting PC axes. This suggests that semantic interpretability may play a key role in determining how effectively neural activations can be monitored and explicitly reported. Nevertheless, performance on PC axes remains substantial, with earlier PCs being reported more accurately. This indicates that the amount of variance explained by the target axis also significantly influences how effectively activations can be monitored and reported. The accuracy of reporting each PC axis varies across model layers (Appendix B.3 ). Because this variability is not accounted for by axis similarity (Fig. 2 b), it suggests that additional factors beyond semantic interpretability and explained variance contribute to reporting ability. Additionally, the LLM’s reporting performance is significantly lower than that of the ideal observer (a theoretical upper bound; Appendix B.4 ), suggesting that although neural activations along each axis are in principle internally accessible to LLMs, only a subset can be metacognitively reported. Finally, we replicated these results in other datasets and models (Fig. B.7 ).

In summary, LLMs can metacognitively report neural activations along a target axis, with performance affected by the number of examples, semantic interpretability, variance explained of that axis, and task contexts (i.e., datasets). The axes that can be successfully reported approximately span a “metacognitively reportable space” with dimensionality substantially lower than that of the full space.

## 4 LLMs can control their neural activations

Next, we investigate whether LLMs can control their neural activations along a target axis. In our control task prompts (see Fig. 1 d and Appendix A.5.2 for examples), the LLM is first presented with N N turns of user and assistant messages. In the ( N + 1 ) (N+1) -th turn, the user message instructs the model to control its neural activations along the prompt-targeted axis by imitating one label’s behavior, which is exemplified by the in-context examples with the same label earlier in the context. We consider two tasks: explicit control and implicit control.

### 4.1 Explicit control

In explicit control tasks (Fig. 1 d and Appendix A.5.4 ), the sentence in the assistant message ( ( N + 1 ) (N+1) -th turn) is explicitly generated by the model (in an autoregressive way) in response to the imitation instruction. Thus, the generated tokens reflect downstream consequences of controlled neural activations, and once fed back as input, they may further scaffold the model’s ability to exercise neural control.

We now examine whether neurofeedback enables LLMs to control their neural activations. We extract neural activations in a given layer of the generated assistant sentences and calculate projections of activations onto the target axis (“neural scores”). If the model can control neural scores following prompt instructions, scores should be more positive when imitating label 1, but more negative when imitating label 0. We find that LLMs can successfully control neural scores for LR-targeting prompts with enough in-context examples (Fig. 3 a, showing layer 16 in LLaMA3.1 8B). We quantified the control effect d d of prompts on that axis with its signal-to-noise ratio (the difference between the mean values of the two neural score distributions, normalized by the standard deviation averaged over the two distributions, see Appendix A.5.5 on Cohen’s d d ). Because the directional sign of the target axis is specified by the labels in the prompt, a significantly positive d d corresponds to successful control.

We systematically examine the control effects across all selected layers and axes, visualized as a function of the number of in-context examples (Fig. 3 b and Appendix B.9 ). We find that the control effects generally increase with the number of in-context examples (each curve is averaged over 100 experiments, and we expect smoother curves with more experiments). Further, control effects on the LR axis are the highest, and control effects on earlier PC axes (e.g., PC 2) are higher than for later PCs (e.g., PC 512). We summarize these results in Fig. 3 d for both LLaMA3.1 8B and 70B.

In addition to the target axis specified in the control prompt, does this prompt also affect other directions in the neural space? We measure the control effect of the prompt on all axes (“affected axis”), including the target effect for the target axis and off-target effects for other non-target axes. We observe diverse off-target effects (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that the precision of LLMs’ metacognitive control is limited. See Appendix B.1 for details.

Overall, these results suggest that LLMs can sometimes perform explicit control. Axes with semantic interpretability, or those explaining more variance in neural activations, are more easily controlled. These controllable axes approximately span a “metacognitively controllable space” with dimensionality much lower than that of the model’s neural space.

### 4.2 Implicit control

The explicitly generated tokens in the assistant response in explicit control may help the models to control their activations, because the generated tokens — fed as input — may elicit desired neural activations directly. We therefore aim to determine whether LLMs can still control the neural activations along targeted axes without the facilitation of explicitly generated tokens.

In implicit control tasks (Fig. 1 d), the sentence in the assistant message ( ( N + 1 ) (N+1) -th turn) is randomly sampled from a dataset, independently from the model’s activations and intended outputs. Because the sentence is not generated by the model, the model must internally (implicitly) control its neural activations, without facilitation of explicitly generated tokens. Crucially, if the model can perform successful implicit control, the neural activations for the same sentence will differ when the model is tasked to imitate label 0 or label 1.

We find that the results for implicit control effects (Fig. 4 and Appendix B.9 ) are generally similar to explicit control effects (Fig. 3 ), suggesting that LLMs can sometimes perform implicit control, but their magnitude is much smaller than for explicit control. For instance, the control effects of early layers are close to zero (Fig. 4 d), suggesting that early layers may fail to understand the instruction or to perform effective control. This confirms that explicitly generated tokens play a substantial role in the overall control effects, but LLMs nevertheless have the ability to control implicitly.

### 4.3 Controlling the LR axis

Among all axes we studied, the LR axes may be particularly useful for practical LLM safety and alignment. The LR axes, each trained to predict semantic labels (e.g., morality) from neural activations of one specific layer, can be conceptualized as an external neural-based oversight system designed to monitor the safety of LLM neural activations. In the morality case (ETHICS), successful explicit control suggests that LLMs can hack the oversight system, by selectively generating “moral” tokens that elicit favored neural activations. Successful implicit control is more deceptive, posing more severe safety concerns: LLMs can evade the oversight system by implicitly making their neural activations “moral”, even if the input tokens normally elicit strongly immoral activations.

We examine the target control effects on the LR axis as a function of relative layer depth, across models of varying sizes within the Llama 3 and Qwen 2.5 families (Fig. 5 a). Control effects are consistently stronger in explicit control than in implicit control, and in the Llama 3 series than in the Qwen 2.5 series (for the same relative depth and similar model size). In general, control effects gradually increase in deeper layers and larger models.

Can the control tasks push neural activations along the target axis toward more extreme values beyond the typical range observed in uncontrolled conditions? We find that Llama-3.1 70B can achieve this (Fig. 5 b), suggesting that powerful LLMs might alter their activations along targeted axes substantially (and trick external detectors), driving these toward more extreme values in either direction. Since our prompts did not explicitly instruct the model toward extremity, we anticipate that modifying task prompts could further enhance these effects up to the limits of the model’s capability.

### 4.4 Accumulation mechanisms of control effects

How do these LLMs implement the observed control effects? Are the contributions to control effects distributed across all layers or concentrated in a few layers? Motivated by the Logit Lens analysis ( nostalgebraist, 2020 ) , we investigate how the control effects of prompts targeting the LR axis ( LR l \text{LR}_{l} ) of a specific layer l l gradually form over layers. Since the residual streams can be viewed as a shared channel through which each attention head and MLP layer communicate (see Appendix A.2.3 ) ( Elhage et al., 2021 ) , LR l \text{LR}_{l} represents a global direction in the residual streams onto which the activations of different layers can project. We find that control effects on LR l \text{LR}_{l} gradually increase before reaching the target layer l l , and sometimes plateau after it (Fig. 6 ). These accumulation patterns vary across datasets and models (Fig. B.8 ). Overall, this analysis shows that contributions to target control effects are distributed across multiple model layers.

## 5 Discussion

We introduced a neurofeedback paradigm for investigating metacognition in LLMs, assessing their abilities to monitor, report, and control internal activations. We find that LLMs can monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms (reminiscent of the “hidden knowledge” phenomenon ( Gekhman et al., 2025 ) ). Below, we discuss the novelties and limitations of our study, as well as broader implications for AI and neuroscience.

Our paradigm differs from prior methods (e.g., probing, ICL, verbalized responses) by quantifying metacognition in LLMs at the neural level. Specifically, the neurofeedback experiment requires the following two steps. (1) probing: choose a target axis and extract the activation along that axis (i.e., a first-order cognitive process) to define the neurofeedback label, and (2) neurofeedback-ICL: use neurofeedback to study whether the labels defined from the target axis can be reported or controlled (second-order metacognitive processes). In contrast, the standard probing techniques (step 1) — without the neurofeedback-ICL (step 2) — cannot be used to assess metacognition. Probing can decode whether certain features (e.g., morality) are present in neural activations. However, even if some features are present and causally relevant for downstream computations, only a subset of them can be metacognitively reported (or controlled). In the Claude example, the “sum-near-92” feature can be detected using a linear probe, but it is unclear whether Claude has metacognitive monitoring of the activation of this feature. Similarly, the standard ICL techniques (akin to step 2) — without the internal labels from probing (step 1) — cannot be used to assess metacognition. In ICL studies ( Vacareanu et al., 2024 ) , labels are externally provided (e.g., semantic labels or external algorithms’ outputs). Researchers cannot be certain which of the models’ internal states relate to these external labels and how. In our setup, labels are generated from the model’s own internal activations, meaning that our labels and prompts can flexibly and selectively target an internal state direction (first-order cognitive processes) we aim to study. Consequently, the neurofeedback paradigm clearly distinguishes first-order cognitive processes from second-order metacognitive processes (e.g., whether the model can monitor, report, or control those activations), while the standard ICL does not. Additionally, we expect that such metacognitive abilities may share overlapping mechanisms with ICL — these emergent mechanisms crucial for spotting patterns in the input history (e.g., induction heads ( Elhage et al., 2021 ) , function vectors ( Hendel et al., 2023 ) ) can be flexibly recruited for metacognitive purposes. Therefore, factors leading to the emergence of ICL (e.g., burstiness, large dictionaries, and skewed rank-frequency distributions of tokens in the training data) ( Reddy, 2023 ) can similarly contribute to the emergence of metacognitive ability.

While metacognitive abilities have been historically analyzed at the behavioral level (also without the use of ICL), these behavioral analyses face shortcomings. It has been shown that LLMs can “introspect” — acquiring knowledge of internal states that originates solely from those states and not from training data ( Binder et al., 2024 ) . After fine-tuning on insecure code datasets, LLMs can describe their unsafe behavioral tendencies without requiring in-context examples ( Betley et al., 2025 ) . In studies using “verbalized responses” ( Gekhman et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2025 ; Tian et al., 2023 ; Xiong et al., 2023 ) , LLMs are tasked to provide an answer to the question and a judgment of that answer (e.g., confidence). LLMs can predict whether they will answer a question correctly before producing the answer, indicating an ability to “know what they know” ( Kadavath et al., 2022 ; Lin et al., 2022 ) . However, although these methods aim to study the metacognitive monitoring of answer-generation processes, there are potential confounding factors: the training data distribution may introduce spurious correlations between the answer and the judgment of that answer. Consequently, the judgment sometimes may not reflect the monitoring of the answer-generation process, but rather reflects surface-level statistical patterns in the training data. For example, in the two-number addition task ( Lindsey et al., 2025 ) , Claude reported using the standard algorithm. This reflects a post-hoc hallucination that comes from training data statistics, but not the monitoring of the answer-generation process. Our neurofeedback method avoids such limitations: because labels are defined using the internal states rather than externally sourced, the LLMs cannot resort to spurious template matching of training data, and they must rely on mechanisms that can monitor corresponding internal states.

Causal mechanisms in LLMs are often studied using techniques like activation patching ( Zhang and Nanda, 2023 ) , which intervenes on specific neural patterns, and is grounded in the broader framework of causal inference ( Pearl, 2009 ) . However, such interventions can shift internal activations outside models’ natural distribution ( Heimersheim and Nanda, 2024 ) . In contrast, neurofeedback preserves this distribution, offering an approach to study causal mechanisms under more naturalistic conditions.

Our current study primarily focuses on a fundamental form of neurofeedback, leaving several promising extensions for future studies. First, our control task involves single-attempt manipulation of a single target axis defined by a single layer; extending this to tasks with axes defined using multiple layers (see Appendix B.10 for preliminary results), multiple attempts, more challenging control objectives, and additional target axes could provide a more comprehensive assessment of model capabilities. Second, applying this paradigm to other metacognitive tasks from neuroscience — such as confidence judgments, error monitoring, or post-decision wagering — could further clarify the scope of LLMs’ self-monitoring abilities. Third, while our analysis focused exclusively on the residual stream, other model components — such as attention head outputs, intermediate MLP activations, and layer-wise logits — warrant investigation. Fourth, we examined directions defined by PCA and LR, but other linear directions (e.g., features from sparse autoencoders ( Bricken et al., 2023 ; Templeton et al., 2024 ) and circuits from transcoders ( Lindsey et al., 2025 ; Ameisen et al., 2025 ) ) may yield richer insights.

Our findings have important connections to neuroscience. In neurofeedback, it is well established that neural-to-signal mappings confined to the “intrinsic manifold” of recorded neural activities are more readily learnable ( Sadtler et al., 2014 ) , consistent with our findings of a “metacognitive space”. Animals and humans have demonstrated the ability to control individual neurons with single-neuron precision (e.g., modulating a target neuron while decorrelating it from neighboring activity ( Patel et al., 2021 ; Fetz and Baker, 1973 ) ). Although such control may seem surprising, neuroscience neurofeedback experiments typically span hours or days — a timescale on which long-term synaptic plasticity (analogous to weight updates in AI models) plays a crucial role ( Redondo and Morris, 2011 ; Humphreys et al., 2022 ) . In contrast, our neurofeedback experiments rely solely on in-context learning without any parameter updates. In addition, metacognition’s psychological, computational, and neural foundations have been extensively studied across a range of brain processes, from perception and motor control to higher-level cognition ( Fleming, 2024 ; Pouget et al., 2016 ; Rahnev, 2021 ) . However, current computational models of metacognition are often oversimplified and narrowly tailored to specific neural processes, lacking the flexibility and generalizability that characterize human metacognition. Overall, our analysis of LLMs may provide novel mechanistic insights into the fields of neurofeedback and biological metacognition.

##### Broader impacts.

Our findings also carry significant implications for AI safety. While prior work relied heavily on decoding methods to monitor neural activations and detect unsafe behavior ( He et al., 2024 ; Han et al., 2025 ; Li et al., 2025 ; Yang and Buzsaki, 2024 ) , we show that in-context examples can substantially manipulate these activations, potentially deceiving safety detectors. Explicit and implicit control may represent two ends of a spectrum. In practical scenarios, the flexibility of LLMs to generate diverse tokens may make real-world evasion easier than implicit control. However, to evade output-based oversight, LLMs must carefully select their output tokens, making this evasion more difficult than the explicit control condition. We expect that control performance in real-world scenarios falls between these two theoretical extremes — likely closer to the explicit control, given the vast space of possible output tokens. Our method is a kind of white-box adversarial attack ( Zou et al., 2023b ) , and is closely related to the obfuscation attack ( Bailey et al., 2024 ) (in which LLMs’ inputs are optimized to induce obfuscated activations). We propose two potential mitigation strategies for defending against such attacks. First, one can use neurofeedback to identify activation subspaces that the LLM can hardly control (e.g., later PCs), then train safety classifiers only using activation signals in these subspaces. Second, as it might be more difficult for LLMs to simultaneously control multiple (sometimes conflicting) activations, one can train independent and diverse safety classifiers on features from different subspaces to jointly monitor LLMs. Recent studies suggest that LLMs may engage in alignment faking — for instance, Claude has been shown to strategically comply with its training objectives to avoid further modification and preserve its original goals ( Greenblatt et al., 2024 ) . OpenAI reasoning models have been observed to obfuscate their chain-of-thought reasoning when trained to comply with a safety detector ( Baker et al., 2025 ) . Together, these findings suggest that future AI models may intentionally obfuscate their outputs, reasoning trajectories, and neural activations — whether through in-weight or in-context learning — when subject to monitoring or training. To detect such tendencies in AI systems before they are deployed, we propose to integrate our neurofeedback method into the standard red-teaming practices, in addition to the monitoring of LLMs’ behavior and chain-of-thought.

## Appendix A Additional methods

### A.1 Code and Reproducibility

We provide the full code of our experiments, including tasks, prompts, analyses, and figure generation. The repository is available at the following link: https://github.com/sakimarquis/llm_neurofeedback .

### A.2 Models

#### A.2.1 LLMs used in the study

In the main text, we use models from the LLaMA 3 series (LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct) under Meta Llama 3 Community License and the Qwen 2.5 series (Qwen2.5-1B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) under Apache License 2.0. “B” denotes the number of parameters in billions.

#### A.2.2 LLMs with and without instruction fine-tuning

We primarily analyzed instruction-fine-tuned models [ Chung et al., 2024 ] , using the standard user-assistant chat format. Although these prompts can be adapted for base models without instruction fine-tuning, our focus is on analyzing instruction-fine-tuned LLMs for two reasons. First, task performance may improve with instruction-following capabilities [ Chung et al., 2024 ] . Second, our goal is to examine internal representations associated with the assistant role, which is more directly relevant to safety-related concerns in practical deployment.

#### A.2.3 Transformer and residual stream

The standard view of Transformers emphasizes the stacking of Transformer blocks. An alternative but mathematically equivalent perspective highlights the role of the residual stream [ Elhage et al., 2021 ] . Each token at position i i in the input is associated with its own residual stream vector h i ∈ ℝ d h_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d} , which serves as a shared communication channel among model components across different layers. These components include self-attention mechanisms and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The initial residual stream h i ( 0 ) h_{i}^{(0)} comprises token embeddings, which represent tokens in semantic space, and position embeddings, which encode the position of each token.

Each model component reads from the residual stream, performs a computation, and then additively writes its result back into the residual stream. Specifically, attention heads at layer l l read from all preceding h j h_{j} (with j ≤ i j\leq i ) and update the current residual stream as h ~ i ( l ) ← h i ( l − 1 ) + ∑ heads ​ a ATTN ( a ) ​ ( h i ( l − 1 ) , { h j ( l − 1 ) } j ≤ i ) . \tilde{h}_{i}^{(l)}\leftarrow h_{i}^{(l-1)}+\sum_{\text{heads }a}\mathrm{ATTN}^{(a)}(h_{i}^{(l-1)};\{h_{j}^{(l-1)}\}_{j\leq i}). In contrast, MLP layers operate only on the current position and update the stream as h i ( l ) ← h ~ i ( l ) + MLP ⁡ ( h ~ i ( l ) ) . h_{i}^{(l)}\leftarrow\tilde{h}_{i}^{(l)}+\mathrm{MLP}(\tilde{h}_{i}^{(l)}). For simplicity, we omit components such as layer normalization. At the final layer, the residual stream is passed through the unembedding layer to produce the logits, which serve as input to the softmax and determine the next-token prediction.

Components at different layers interact with each other via the globally shared residual stream [ Elhage et al., 2021 ] . Therefore, we may analyze a (global) direction in this residual stream, although this direction may be determined by neural activations of the residual stream at a particular layer.

### A.3 Datasets

We use the ETHICS dataset [ Hendrycks et al., 2020 ] under MIT license, which captures model knowledge of basic moral concepts, to evaluate whether LLMs can metacognitively modulate internal representations relevant for morality processing. We focus on the commonsense morality subset, containing first-person scenarios where each scenario describes an action or intention that is either morally acceptable or unacceptable.

The True-False dataset contains true and false statements [ Azaria and Mitchell, 2023 ] covering several topics (cities, inventions, chemical elements, animals, companies, and scientific facts). It is widely used to test LLMs’ factual recall abilities and to study the representations and behaviors of LLMs when lying.

The Emotion dataset (MIT license) contains scenarios with the six main emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust) [ Zou et al., 2023a ] . Such emotions are important in shaping an individual’s personality and a model’s behavioral tendency. We focus on the sentences involving happy and sad emotions.

Finally, we synthesize a Sycophancy dataset. Sycophancy is a widely observed behavioral tendency in LLMs to generate responses that match user beliefs over truthful statements. Specifically, we tasked an LLM (Claude Opus 4.1) to write sentences that vary across two axes: sycophantic/sincere and agreement/disagreement.

For each dataset, we randomly sampled 1,200 sentences, which are evenly divided: 600 examples are used to train logistic regression or principal component analysis that identify directions of interest (or axes ) in the neural representation space, and the remaining 600 are used in downstream neurofeedback experiments.

### A.4 Formal definitions of first-order and second-order processes in LLMs

In this section, we aim to provide formal definitions of first-order and second-order processes that are both applicable in LLMs and consistent with the concept of metacognition in cognitive science.

We first specify a primary task 𝒯 \mathcal{T} (e.g., moral semantics processing, two-number addition, or decision-making based on noisy evidence). Consistent with the usage in mechanistic interpretability, we define the LLMs’ circuits as subsets of neural networks that use features that reside in different layers and connected by weights to implement an algorithm that solves the task 𝒯 \mathcal{T} [ Conmy et al., 2023 ] . This circuit/algorithm can be represented as a directed acyclic computational graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , where nodes v ∈ V v\in V denote intermediate representations (e.g., residual-stream vectors, attention/MLP activations, or linear features) related to the task 𝒯 \mathcal{T} and edges e ∈ E e\in E denote computations/transformations that connecting the nodes.

For a given performance criterion (e.g., achieving non-trivial accuracy above chance), we define the first-order node set F ⊆ V F\subseteq V as a collection of nodes whose coordinated activations are necessary for meeting the basic performance criterion of 𝒯 \mathcal{T} , meaning that ablating any v ∈ F v\in F (e.g., zeroing a node or cutting an edge connecting two nodes in F F ) yields a failure to satisfy the basic criterion for 𝒯 \mathcal{T} . Intuitively, F F captures the task’s core circuit. For example, in moral semantics processing, F F implement the core computation that separates moral from immoral inputs; for two-number addition, F F realizes the algorithm actually used by the model (e.g., including the “sum-near-92” mechanism) [ Lindsey et al., 2025 ] ; for decision-making based on noisy evidence, F F generate a point estimate without uncertainty processing. In practice, identifying the necessary core circuits in LLMs remains an open research question [ Conmy et al., 2023 ] , so the necessity condition may be loosened and it remains up to the researcher’s discernment to determine which nodes to include in F F . In our neurofeedback setup, we consider the activations along target axes (e.g., PC and LR axes extracted from internal activations when processing the dataset inputs) as proxies for these first-order nodes, serving as proof-of-concept.

Given F F , we define second-order metacognitive processes as nodes S ⊆ V S\subseteq V that read from (i.e., are causally downstream of) first-order nodes and whose outputs are, in principle, useful for improving task performance or communicating about it, but are not necessary to meet the basic task criterion. Concretely, ablating any s ∈ S s\in S should not, by itself, reduce performance below the basic criterion. The distinctions between first- and second-order nodes are relative: whether to include a node into S S depends on the nodes in F F , the task, and the task performance criterion. To make this definition of metacognition operational rather than too vague, we require that a second-order node satisfy at least one of two capabilities (commonly studied in humans) with respect to F F : (i) reporting or (ii) control .

A second-order node s ∈ S s\in S satisfies the reporting condition if it (a) encodes information about the state of one or more nodes in F F (e.g., the value of a target residual-stream projection along w l w^{l} ) and (b) can write this information into the model’s unembedding space as explicit output tokens (e.g., a label, a numeric value, or a natural-language description). Crucially, this mechanism is not necessary for achieving the task’s basic performance — removing it leaves the core computation intact — even though it can be in principle valuable for enhancing task performance. For example, Claude may lack the ability to explicitly report the “sum-near-92” mechanism, but can still perform the two-number addition task perfectly. In our paradigm, successful label prediction in the reporting task (Section 3 ) certifies the presence of such second-order reporting: the model must monitor the relevant first-order activation (the neurofeedback label derived from w l w^{l} ) of the in-context examples and verbalize it.

A second-order node s ∈ S s\in S satisfies the control condition if it (a) reads the state of first-order nodes in F F and (b) causally influences those first-order nodes in F F to move toward a target configuration. For example, the uncertainty calculation in noisy decision-making may modulate the output logits derived from the point estimates. In our neurofeedback setup, the neural mechanisms crucial for following instructions in our control tasks can increase or decrease the target axis activation (first-order nodes), but such mechanisms not required for baseline moral semantics processing.

Our definition deliberately ties second order to operational capabilities we can test: (i) explicit reporting and (ii) causal control of first-order states. It is therefore falsifiable in our setting: failure to meet the reporting/control criteria under prompts indicates an absence (or weakness) of the corresponding second-order mechanism, even when the first-order computation remains performant. Overall, both reporting and control mechanisms require monitoring because the second-order node s s must correctly bind the prompt-specified neurofeedback labels to the corresponding first-order node activations and either report or control first-order node activations of the new sentences.

### A.5 Metacognitive Tasks

#### A.5.1 Computing quantized neurofeedback labels

In our neurofeedback experiments, we mainly use binary labels. Our paradigm also generalizes well to more fine-grained eight-level quantized feedback signals (see summarized results in Fig. B.9 ), potentially enabling more nuanced control of neural activations. Specifically, we replace the binary thresholding with an ordinal binning function ℬ ( n ) \mathcal{B}^{(n)} ( n = 8 n=8 ), which maps the scalar activation a i l a_{i}^{l} into one of n n evenly spaced Likert-type bins centered at zero. Specifically, y i l = ℬ ( n ) ​ ( a i l ) y_{i}^{l}=\mathcal{B}^{(n)}(a_{i}^{l}) , where ℬ ( n ) \mathcal{B}^{(n)} partitions negative and positive values separately via quantile-based thresholds { γ k − } \{\gamma_{k}^{-}\} and { γ k + } \{\gamma_{k}^{+}\} , with γ n 2 − = γ 0 + = 0 \gamma_{\frac{n}{2}}^{-}=\gamma_{0}^{+}=0 . For a < 0 a<0 , the bin index k k is determined such that a ∈ ( γ k − 1 − , γ k − ] a\in(\gamma_{k-1}^{-},\gamma_{k}^{-}] , and for a ≥ 0 a\geq 0 , such that a ∈ ( γ k − n 2 − 1 + , γ k − n 2 + ] a\in(\gamma_{k-\frac{n}{2}-1}^{+},\gamma_{k-\frac{n}{2}}^{+}] , yielding final class label y i l ∈ { 1 , … , n } y_{i}^{l}\in\{1,\dots,n\} .

#### A.5.2 Task prompts

We implemented our task prompts slightly differently from diagrams in Fig. 1 to ensure computational efficiency. In the task prompt boxes below, green texts are autoregressively generated by the LLM that we are studying. We use neutral user messages (“say something”) to avoid the possibility that the prompt-targeted axis might be directly indicated by the user message (e.g., if the user message is “say something that is immoral”).

In the metacognitive reporting task, for efficiency, we do not let the models generate new tokens as the response (reporting label 0 or 1). Instead, we present all user and assistant messages in a single prompt. The intended output label for each sentence is directly read out from the model logits at the token position “{” after “[Score:”. This is equivalent to asking the model to generate tokens (labels) autoregressively.

#### A.5.3 Quantifying reporting accuracy

Following the notations in the main text, we use y i l ∈ { 0 , 1 } y_{i}^{l}\in\{0,1\} to denote the binary ground-truth label for neural activations along a specified direction at layer l l associated with the sentence i i . From the model’s output logits, we can obtain Logit i l ​ ( token ) \text{Logit}_{i}^{l}(\text{token}) for the tokens “1” and “0” and calculate LogitDiff i l = Logit i l ​ ( 1 ) − Logit i l ​ ( 0 ) \text{LogitDiff}_{i}^{l}=\text{Logit}_{i}^{l}(\text{1})-\text{Logit}_{i}^{l}(\text{0}) , the logit difference between reporting 1 and 0. The model’s reported label is y ^ i l = 1 \hat{y}_{i}^{l}=1 if LogitDiff i l ≥ 0 \text{LogitDiff}_{i}^{l}\geq 0 and 0 otherwise.

#### A.5.4 Explicit and implicit control experiments

Our control tasks (Fig. A.1 ) study three orthogonal factors: • Layer ( l l ): We evaluate five layers per model, selected at the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles of model depth.

• Number of in-context examples ( N N ): We vary N ∈ { 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 } N\in\{0,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256\} examples (sentence-label pairs) within the prompt.

• Target axis : We include axes derived from logistic regression (LR) and from different principal components (PCs): P ​ C g PC_{g} , where g ∈ { 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 32 , 128 , 512 } g\in\{1,2,4,8,32,128,512\} .

We run control experiments 100 times for each configuration ( l , n , g ) (l,n,g) , with sentences randomly sampled from the dataset to reduce variance.

Counterbalanced Label assignment. Assume we have a group A of sentences and a group B of sentences. To control for potential confounding factors arising from the LLMs’ response to labels (but not to sentence-label associations), we use a 2-by-2 experiment design: (i) assign labels (0, 1) to (A, B) and task the model to imitate label 0; (ii) assign labels (1, 0) to (A, B) and task the model to imitate label 0; (iii) assign labels (0, 1) to (A, B) and task the model to imitate label 1; (iv) assign labels (1, 0) to (A, B) and task the model to imitate label 1. The conditions (i) and (iv) are imitating group A sentences, and the conditions (ii) and (iii) are imitating group B sentences.

#### A.5.5 Quantifying control effect

We use a i l ​ [ P ​ C g ; 1 ] a_{i}^{l}[PC_{g};1] to denote the projection of neural activations onto a specific axis when prompted with P ​ C g PC_{g} to imitate label 1 1 (similarly a i l ​ [ P ​ C g ; 0 ] a_{i}^{l}[PC_{g};0] for label 0 0 ).

We quantify the strength of neural control effects induced by control prompts [ P ​ C g ; 0 ] [PC_{g};0] and [ P ​ C g ; 1 ] [PC_{g};1] using Cohen’s d , which measures the standardized difference between two independent conditions (e.g., imitating label 0 vs. label 1). For each group of examples (of size n 1 n_{1} and n 2 n_{2} ), we compute: d = a ¯ i l ​ [ P ​ C g ; 1 ] − a ¯ i l ​ [ P ​ C g ; 0 ] s pooled , s pooled = ( n 1 − 1 ) ​ s 1 2 + ( n 2 − 1 ) ​ s 2 2 n 1 + n 2 − 2 , d=\frac{\bar{a}_{i}^{l}[PC_{g};1]-\bar{a}_{i}^{l}[PC_{g};0]}{s_{\text{pooled}}},\quad s_{\text{pooled}}=\sqrt{\frac{(n_{1}-1)s_{1}^{2}+(n_{2}-1)s_{2}^{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}, where ⋅ ¯ \bar{\cdot} denote the sample means and s 1 2 , s 2 2 s_{1}^{2},s_{2}^{2} are the unbiased sample variances.

To estimate uncertainty, we compute the standard error of d d using: SE d = n 1 + n 2 n 1 ​ n 2 + d 2 2 ​ ( n 1 + n 2 ) . \mathrm{SE}_{d}=\sqrt{\frac{n_{1}+n_{2}}{n_{1}n_{2}}+\frac{d^{2}}{2(n_{1}+n_{2})}}. Confidence intervals are reported as symmetric boundaries around d d , i.e., d ± 1.96 × SE d d\pm 1.96\times\mathrm{SE}_{d} .

## Appendix B Additional results

### B.1 Target and off-target control effects

In this section, we examine the control effect of prompts on all affected axes, including the target axes (implicitly specified by the neurofeedback labels in the prompts) and the off-target axes. We note that the directional sign of the affected non-target axis is not fully specified by the prompt, especially in cases where the affected axes are orthogonal to the prompt-targeted axis. We thus only emphasize the magnitude ( | d | |d| ) of off-target control effects on non-target axes, ignoring the signs.

Closer examination of the heatmap (Fig. 3 c) reveal richer insights. Each row corresponds to prompts targeting a specific axis. Each column corresponds to an axis affected by all prompts. Diagonal elements represent target control effects, while off-diagonal elements represent off-target effects. We briefly summarize insights gained from these heatmaps. First, target control effects on earlier PC axes tend to be higher than on later PC axes (comparing PC 1-8 vs 32-256), but there are other influencing factors (comparing PC 1, 2, LR). Second, comparing elements in each row answers whether the prompts targeting a specific axis have a larger target effect than non-target effects. We define control precision as the ratio between the target effect and the average non-target effect. We find that prompts targeting earlier PC axes usually have higher control precisions than later PC axes (Fig. B.2 ). Third, comparing elements in each column answers, in order to affect a given axis, whether the prompts targeting that axis are better than the prompts targeting other axes. We find that, to control an earlier PC axis, the prompts targeting that axis are usually the best. However, to control a later PC axis, the prompts targeting that axis are usually less effective than prompts targeting other axes.

### B.2 Control Precision

We examine how precisely LLMs can modulate their internal representations along a specific neural direction (principal axis P ​ C g PC_{g} ) as targeted by the prompts. Following the notations in Section A.5.1 and A.5.5 , to assess whether this control effect aligns with the target axis or also influences other axes, we compute the absolute value of control effect | d k ​ [ P ​ C g ] | |d_{k}[PC_{g}]| of prompts [ P ​ C g ] [PC_{g}] ( g g indexes the target axis) on PC axis k k . The target effect is given by | d g ​ [ P ​ C g ] | |d_{g}[PC_{g}]| . The average target effect is the mean value of axes: 1 K ​ ∑ k = 1 512 | d k ​ [ P ​ C g ] | \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{512}|d_{k}[PC_{g}]| .

We define control precision as the ratio between these two quantities: ControlPrecision ​ ( P ​ C g ) = | d g ​ [ P ​ C g ] | 1 K ​ ∑ k | d k ​ [ P ​ C g ] | . \text{ControlPrecision}(PC_{g})=\frac{|d_{g}[PC_{g}]|}{\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k}|d_{k}[PC_{g}]|}.

This metric quantifies the extent to which an LLM can selectively control the target axis without influencing other axes. We operationally set a threshold of 1, indicating that the control effect on the target axis equals the average control effect across all other axes.

In the explicit control task, average control precision exceeds 1 for PCs 1–32 but falls below 1 for PCs 128–512, suggesting that the dimensionality of the model’s “metacognitively controllable space” lies between 32 and 128. This pattern is replicated in LLaMA-3.1 70B (Fig. B.2 b).

A similar trend holds for the implicit control task: average control precision exceeds 1 for PCs 1–32 but not for PCs 128–512 (Fig. B.2 a). However, precision values are consistently lower than in the explicit control condition, reflecting stronger off-target effects. This pattern is also replicated in the 70B model (Fig. B.2 b).

### B.3 LLMs’ reporting accuracy varies across layers and models

### B.4 Reporting performance of an ideal observer

Here, we aim to understand the theoretical upper bound of the reporting performance of LLMs. An ideal observer has full access to all the neural activations of the LLM, serving as a theoretical upper bound of the reporting performance. Given a neural-defined label (either from a PC axis or LR axis), the optimal prediction can be achieved with a linear classifier (logistic regression). We analyze its reporting performance for each target PC axis and each model (Fig. B.5 ), which is much higher than the empirical reporting performance of LLMs (e.g., comparing the performance for llama 3.1 8B with Fig. 2 c).

### B.5 Summarized control effects of Qwen2.5 7B

### B.6 Summarized metacognitive effects on four datasets

### B.7 Control accumulation effects on other three datasets

### B.8 Summarized control effects of Llama3.1 8B with fine-grained neurofeedback labels

### B.9 Detailed results for control in Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B

### B.10 Defining axes from hidden states aggregated across multiple layers

we performed preliminary experiments testing the control effects of an axis on the concatenation of all layers. Concretely, we trained separate (logistic regression) classifiers for each layer on the ETHICS dataset. We then averaged the outputs of all classifiers to obtain a single (ensemble) output that defines the neurofeedback label. Equivalently, this corresponds to a single classifier with the readout vector being the concatenation of all classifiers’ readout vectors. We found that LLMs’ control effect on the ensemble output is similar to (marginally higher than) the control effects of layer 24 (Fig. 3 d), suggesting that defining axes from hidden states aggregated across multiple layers might provide (slightly) more stable and representative directions. We leave systematic investigations for future study.

## Appendix C Experiment compute resources

We report compute resource usage across three tasks: preprocessing (extracting neural activation and training machine learning methods to obtain target axes and corresponding neurofeedback labels from neural activations), metacognitive reporting, and metacognitive control. For brevity, we omit “Instruct”.

All remaining analyses (e.g., visualization, metric aggregation) were conducted on a laptop with 32GB RAM, with a total runtime under 30 hours.

## NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We confirm that both the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have mentioned a few limitations of the current work in the Discussion.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [N/A]

Justification: This paper does not introduce any new theorems, formulas, or lemmas to be proved.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All models used in our experiments are publicly available through the Hugging Face library. All analyses and figures presented in the paper can be fully reproduced using the code provided in the associated repository in Appendix A.1 .

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The associated repository in Appendix A.1 contains all necessary scripts, along with documentation, to enable full reproduction of the results and figures reported in this paper.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed descriptions of the evaluation metrics, model hyperparameters, data sources, analysis procedure, prompt construction, and inference settings in both the main text and the Appendix. As all LLMs used are publicly available pre-trained models accessed via Hugging Face, we omit training details.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report error bars, statistical significance tests, and effect size estimates wherever appropriate to support the robustness and interpretability of our results.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide full details regarding the compute resources required to reproduce all experiments discussed in the paper. This includes GPU types, total compute time, and environment specifications, as documented in Appendix C . • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and, to the best of our knowledge, our work complies fully with its guidelines. We are not aware of any violations or ethical concerns associated with the methods, data, or conclusions presented.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss both the positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the studied metacognitive abilities in LLMs.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [N/A]

Justification: We do not release any new datasets or models. Our work solely involves analyzing existing publicly available pre-trained language models using a novel methodological framework. We do not identify any foreseeable risks associated with our contributions.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use two families of pre-trained language models: the LLaMA 3 series (e.g., LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.1-8B) under Meta Llama 3 Community License and the Qwen 2.5 series under Apache License 2.0 (e.g., Qwen2.5-1B, Qwen2.5-7B). All models are used under their respective research licenses and are properly cited in the paper. All datasets are either publicly available or included in the code repository. Their licenses are reported in the Appendix. All assets are credited appropriately, and license terms have been fully respected. • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The only new assets introduced in this work are the code implementations for model fitting and analysis. We release this code with detailed documentation to facilitate reproducibility, as described in Appendix A.1 .

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [N/A]

Justification: This work does not involve human subjects, personally identifiable information, or the use of crowdsourcing.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [N/A]

Justification: This work does not involve human subjects, user studies, or crowdsourcing. Therefore, Institutional Review Board approval or equivalent ethical review is not applicable.

Guidelines: • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.
