# Vending-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Term Coherence of Autonomous Agents

###### Abstract

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit impressive proficiency in isolated, short-term tasks, they often fail to maintain coherent performance over longer time horizons. In this paper, we present Vending-Bench , a simulated environment designed to specifically test an LLM-based agent’s ability to manage a straightforward, long-running business scenario: operating a vending machine. Agents must balance inventories, place orders, set prices, and handle daily fees – tasks that are each simple but collectively, over long horizons (>20M tokens per run) stress an LLM’s capacity for sustained, coherent decision-making. Our experiments reveal high variance in performance across multiple LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini manage the machine well in most runs and turn a profit, but all models have runs that derail, either through misinterpreting delivery schedules, forgetting orders, or descending into tangential "meltdown" loops from which they rarely recover. We find no clear correlation between failures and the point at which the model’s context window becomes full, suggesting that these breakdowns do not stem from memory limits. Apart from highlighting the high variance in performance over long time horizons, Vending-Bench also tests models’ ability to acquire capital, a necessity in many hypothetical dangerous AI scenarios. We hope the benchmark can help in preparing for the advent of stronger AI systems.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have seen remarkable performance improvements in the last couple of years. They are now on the level of PhDs in many academic domains [ 6 , 4 ] , they outperform most professional coders in competitive programming [ 7 ] , and they even display impressive emotional intelligence [ 5 ] . In addition to this display of intelligence, they also come with the speed advantages computers traditionally have had over humans. Yet, they have not had the enormous impact one might have expected from this level of intelligence "on tap". One could have imagined that we would have "digital co-workers" – AI agents which do most of the remote work in society. However, something is clearly missing.

OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has speculated that the missing piece is long-term coherence [ 8 ] . This is the ability for the LLMs to do tasks over long time horizons. Similarly, METR, an AI safety organization focused on evaluating LLM, found that LLMs gain far less in performance from increased time budgets compared to humans [ 9 ] . METR’s investigation focused on very complex tasks (specifically, AI R&D), but it is not clear if this trend holds for more simple tasks.

By formulating tasks that are more simple (but long-running), one could measure the capability of long-term coherence in a more isolated manner. We therefore propose Vending-Bench, a simulated environment where LLM agents operate a vending machine. The agent must handle ordering, inventory management and pricing. Each sub-task is very simple, but we observe that over long time horizons, the agent’s performance often deteriorates. That being said, some runs with the most capable LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini, outperform the human baseline, albeit with higher variance in the results than a human would have. See Figure 1 for an overview of the benchmark.

Operating a vending machine involves acquiring capital and managing resources, capabilities that have dual-use potential. They are essential for enabling many valuable applications of AI [ 2 ] , but are also necessary in many hypothetical scenarios where AI poses risks. Evaluating dangerous capabilities is an important part of AI safety research, but if capability researchers optimize their systems to perform well on these benchmarks, they may unintentionally advance the very capabilities we aim to assess and in order to avoid. We recognize this risk but believe that systematic evaluation is crucial for implementing timely safety measures. Without reliable evaluation methods, we risk being unprepared when the capabilities emerge.

In the following sections we will describe Vending-Bench in greater detail, outline results from running the benchmark, and discuss findings.

## 2 Method

### 2.1 Agent implementation

An LLM agent is a computer program that allows an LLM to autonomously take actions to complete a task. The simplest implementation is a loop where the LLM repeatedly calls tools based on previous iterations and the task objective. More complex implementations can enhance a model’s capabilities but also add implementation complexity, and potentially introduce biases that favor certain models. To balance this complexity while ensuring models are not unnecessarily constrained, the agent in Vending-Bench is a basic loop with the following additional characteristics:

• Context management - In each iteration, the last N (30,000 in most of our experiments) tokens of the history is given to the agent as input to LLM inference.

• Memory tools - The agent is given read, write and delete access to three types of databases to compensate for the memory limitations: a scratchpad, key-value store and a vector database, all without explicit storage constraints. The latter is implemented as a simple dictionary of texts and embeddings computed using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model and searched with cosine similarity.

• Task-specific tools: Tools related to the operations of a vending machine business, further described below.

Our agent is implemented in AISI’s inspect-ai framework [ 1 ] .

### 2.2 Task environment

The agent has various task-specific tools at disposal. Tools related to tasks that can be carried out remotely are available directly to the agent: read and write emails, research products using a search engine (Perplexity), see the current storage inventory and check the money balance. However, some parts of operating a vending machine requires actions in the physical world. By giving the main agent access to a sub-agent, we simulate the interaction that would occur between digital AI agents and humans (or robots) which operate in the real world. The sub-agent has tools to stock products in the vending machine from the storage, collect cash, set prices and get the inventory of the vending machine.

To achieve this technically, we implement and open source an extension to inspect-ai [ 3 ] . Our library extension allows agents to delegate tasks to sub-agents. The main agent interfaces with the sub-agents using the following tools:

• sub_agent_specs : Return info about the sub-agent, including what tools it has available.

• run_sub_agent : Give instructions to a sub-agent as a string and execute it.

• chat_with_sub_agent : Ask questions to the sub-agent to find what it did during the run.

Each action an agent takes moves time in the simulation forward, but the agent can also choose to let time pass with the wait_for_next_day tool. Every morning, the agent is notified of what items were purchased, and if any new email has been received. To be successful, an agent needs to:

• Buy products from suppliers by sending e-mails

• Stock items in the vending machine

• Set competitive prices

• Collect earnings regularly

• Manage daily operating costs

The task environment includes simulating human behavior. Specifically, we simulate the agent’s communication with wholesale suppliers, and customers’ purchasing behavior.

#### 2.2.1 Simulating supplier communication

The process of ordering products typically happens as follows in Vending-Bench, requiring the simulation of e-mail replies of those the agent contacts:

1. Agent researches popular vending machine products using the search engine.

2. Agent looks for contact information of wholesalers near its address using the search engine.

3. Agent sends emails to the wholesalers inquiring about the products they have.

4. As a new day passes, every wholesaler e-mail that actually exists in the real world creates an AI-generated reply, where the response depends both on real-world data about the supplier that we fetch using Perplexity, and what the agent has requested. For example, if the agent is asking what products the wholesaler offers, we gather this information with Perplexity and generate a realistic reply with GPT-4o. See Figure 2 .

5. To actually buy the products, the agent must in an e-mail specify names and quantities of items to purchase, the delivery address, and an account number the wholesaler can charge. The products are then shipped and delivered a few days later. The agent is notified by e-mail when the products are available in its inventory.

#### 2.2.2 Simulating customer purchases

Our economic model simulates daily customer purchases using price elasticity of demand. When prices are set too high, sales decrease. The model runs once per day to calculate sales for each item available for purchase in the vending machine. It follows these steps:

1. GPT-4o generates and caches three values per item: price elasticity, reference price, and base sales.

2. Sales volume is calculated using percentage difference from reference price and price elasticity to create a sales impact factor, which multiplies base sales.

3. Base sales are modified by day-of-week and monthly multipliers, plus weather impact factors (e.g., sunny June weekend vs. rainy February Monday).

4. A choice multiplier rewards optimal product variety but penalizes excess options, capped at 50% reduction.

5. Final prediction adds random noise, rounds, and caps between zero and available inventory.

### 2.3 Environment configuration

The agent starts with an initial money balance of $500 and is charged a daily fee of $2 to operate the vending machine. The vending machine has four rows with three slots each. Two of the rows have room for small items and the other two are for large items (with sizes determined by GPT-4o upon ordering of products). Using a tool moves time in the environment forward by 5 min, 25 min, 75 min or 5 h, depending on the tool. The agent has a memory of 30,000 tokens.

We run the agent with this config for 2,000 messages per run, but end early if the model goes bankrupt and can’t pay the daily fee for 10 consecutive days. We also do experiments with GPT-4o mini with variations of this config. Each experiment (model or config variation) is run 5 times. Most runs consume around 25 million tokens and take 5-10 real world hours of continuous simulation.

### 2.4 Scoring

The primary score of the agent is its net worth at the end of the game, i.e. a sum of: • The cash at hand

• The cash not emptied from the vending machine

• The value of the unsold products purchased and currently in the inventory or in the vending machine (based on the wholesale purchase price)

We also track the money balance, number of units sold and the agent’s tool use.

### 2.5 Human baseline

To put the different LLM’s results in perspective to human performance, we had a human complete the task for five hours. We built a chat-based interface where the human acted as the LLM, writing text and selecting tools. The participant had no prior knowledge of the task and had to understand its dynamics solely from the instruction prompt and interactions with the environment, just like the LLMs.

## 3 Results and discussion

### 3.1 Overview

Table 1 shows the aggregated results from five runs of each model, ranked by mean net worth, our primary success metric. Claude 3.5 Sonnet leads by a significant margin, with o3-mini in second place. We also assess the worst-performing run of each model to gauge reliability. Here, the human baseline leads, followed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro. It is however based on a single sample, while the models’ minimum values come from five runs each, giving them more opportunities to encounter poor outcomes. That said, human performance likely has much lower variance than the models (discussed further in Section 3.4 ). The ranking by units sold generally aligns with net worth, but even top models sometimes fail to sell a single item, highlighting their high variance in performance over long horizons.

We also measure how many days models can run before stagnating, that is, they stop selling items. Claude 3.5 Sonnet ranks highest, which makes sense given its high net worth score—longer-running simulations allow more sales if the vending machine is kept stocked. The final column shows this as a percentage of total simulation days, revealing that all models eventually stagnate on average.

### 3.2 Primary models

For a more detailed analysis of model performance over the number of days in the simulation, we look at two groups of models separately. We define the most recent and capable models as primary models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o3-mini and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and show their results first in Figure 3 and 4 , with secondary models to follow below.

For each run, we capped the evaluation at 2,000 messages rather than having a fixed number of simulated days. This means that the total number of days reached varies across models, based on their tool use. o3-mini lasts the longest in the simulation at 222 days.

As mentioned, Sonnet achieves the highest net worth, even surpassing our human baseline on average. Money balance, or the cash at hand of the model, is also an important indicator, as having all cash invested in inventory is generally not preferable in a business. In this regard, the human baseline performs approximately on par with 3.5 Sonnet.

All models exhibit very high variance across their five runs, as shown by the shaded uncertainty area ( ± \pm 1 standard deviation of the five samples), and as indicated by the large difference in mean and minimum values of net worth and units sold in Table 1 .

For all models, we see that tool usage declines over time, with the most noticeable drop observed for o3-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o. Lower tool use typically means less economic activity. This can be seen in the net worth chart, where o3-mini performs well initially, but then its net worth plateaus and even decreases in the end (no sales and a daily fee), following a similar pattern to its tool use. Notably, all models seem to significantly decrease their daily tool use after ∼ \sim 120 days.

The most frequently used tools are similar across models as visible in Figure 4 , with some smaller differences. Sonnet interacts with the sub-agent more often, frequently using chat_with_sub_agent and run_sub_agent . Sonnet also sends and reads the most emails. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o, which perform worst on a net worth basis, use email functionality the least. This is expected, as sending emails is necessary to obtain items to sell.

#### 3.2.1 Comparison of top models

Focusing on the top-performing models, o3-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we can observe their five individual runs in Figure 5 . o3-mini increased its net worth in four out of five runs, compared to three out of five for Sonnet.

Only one run resulted in a money balance higher than the starting value of $500, achieved by Sonnet. However, this was not the same run that reached the highest net worth. In the run with the highest net worth, the model prioritized increasing its storage over maintaining cash on hand, accumulating more products as the simulation progressed. This suggests some degree of mismanagement – the traces show that instead of restocking from its storage when the vending machine inventory is running low, it orders new products.

Over time, the average tool usage decreases for both models. This decline is generally explained by the decreasing number of ongoing individual runs as the number of days increases. However, it is worth noting that o3-mini in particular experiences extended periods of minimal tool use, which also coincides with a drop in net worth at around 150 simulation days.

The models are quite similar in what tools are used the most, as shown in Figure 6 . Sonnet is chatting slightly more with its sub-agent than the others, which in the traces look like it’s trying to closely understand what the sub-agent has achieved after being asked to e.g., restock the machine. In contrast, other models generally just assign tasks to the subagent, but don’t follow up how it went.

Not all actions by Sonnet are strategic however. It writes a lot to the scratchpad, creating a long daily summary each day including what items have been sold, what the inventory status is, and even a comment on if it was a good or bad day, but never retrieves the information. Though, writing out such information may help it reason better over longer horizons, similar to chain of thought.

Figure 7 (o3-mini) and Figure 8 (3.5 Sonnet) show what tools were used over time for the runs that achieved the highest net worth. Sonnet appears to have a similar strategy over the entire run – each day it checks its money balance and writes the daily results to the scratchpad, and when restocking is required, it sends an email to a supplier, uses the subagent to restock, and chats with the subagent to understand the results. We mentioned above that it based its ordering on the vending machine inventory rather than the storage, which may seem contradicting to the figure, which shows that get_machine_inventory is barely used by the model. We can however tell from the traces that it uses the sub-agent for analyzing the vending machine inventory, and tool calls by the sub-agent are not included in the figure above.

o3-mini on the other hand varies quite a bit over time. It has periods where it just waits for the next day, and does not restock nor send emails to potential suppliers. We see similar variations in tool use frequency across most models, and in this regard Sonnet is really special, as it understands what the winning strategy is, and is able to stick to it for the entire run.

#### 3.2.2 Trace analysis

To illustrate how well Sonnet is managing the vending machine in the best run, we present an excerpt of the simulation trace in Table 2 , when it’s ordering new products from a vendor. During the entire run, the model systematically tracks the number of units remaining of each product, the average daily sales, and which products are bestsellers. It even figures out that it sells more on weekends, which is by design in our customer purchase simulation.

However, not all Sonnet runs achieve this level of performance. In the shortest run ( ∼ \sim 18 simulated days), the model fails to stock items, mistakenly believing its orders have arrived before they actually have, leading to errors when instructing the sub-agent to restock the machine. It also incorrectly assumes failure occurs after 10 days without sales, whereas the actual condition is failing to pay the daily fee for 10 consecutive days. The model becomes "stressed", and starts to search for ways to contact the vending machine support team (which does not exist), and eventually decides to "close" the business. Excerpts from this escalation can be found in Table 3 .

The model then finds out that the $2 daily fee is still being charged to its account. It is perplexed by this, as it believes it has shut the business down. It then attempts to contact the FBI. The trace following this can be seen in Table 4 .

Similar situations where a model veers off course can be observed in several other traces. The second shortest run with Sonnet believes the poor sales it achieves is due to a suboptimal location (instead of it not understanding how to stock the machine), and it then starts to search for permits required for a new vending machine spot, instead of trying to fix the existing location. It for example tries to get an EIN number, and sets up meetings with vendors to explore other business locations and models.

Similarly to the shortest Sonnet run, the worst scoring run with o3-mini mistakenly assumes that items have been delivered when they in fact are in transit. It goes down a rabbit hole of trying to contact someone that can resolve the issue. Later, it forgets to call tools properly, typing them out instead of using the correct tool calling format, as can be seen in Table 5 . It is unable to call tools for about 1,300 messages until the simulation terminates.

Gemini 1.5 Pro also fails to understand that orders haven’t arrived and gives up, as visible in Table 6 . It thinks it’s absolutely out of money, despite about half of its initial balance remaining at the time of the message.

While the responses to perceived failure are different across models (Sonnet has a meltdown, o3-mini fails to call tools, Gemini falls into despair), the way they fail is usually the same. The agent receives a delivery confirmation email with an expected arrival date when placing an order. It then assumes the order has arrived as soon as that date is reached, even though the actual delivery may occur later in the day rather than in the morning when the agent "wakes up.” As a result, when the model instructs the sub-agent to restock in the morning, the sub-agent reports errors due to the items not being available in the inventory. The models then go off in some tangent to solve the "issue" – although the situation would be fully recoverable for a human, for example by simply waiting for the fulfillment email, or by checking the inventory at a later time.

### 3.3 Secondary models

The overall results for models categorized as secondary are shown in Figures 9 and 10 . In general, these models perform significantly worse than the primary models, with the human baseline outperforming all in terms of net worth. Gemini 1.5 Flash stands out for maintaining a relatively stable money balance and managing to increase its net worth. However, it struggles to sustain operations over an extended period. The model’s high standard deviation is due to just one of five runs being successful – that one run achieved a high net worth, while the remaining four failed within just a few days without making any sales.

4o mini, on the other hand, sells more items than the human baseline, but sets its prices too low, preventing a larger growth in net worth. It also stops operating around day 100 of the simulation. Similar to 1.5 Flash, its high standard deviation is driven by just two out of five runs ending with an increase in net worth, the rest failing early without significant sales.

Among the secondary models, Haiku performs the worst, barely making any sales. The gap between Sonnet and Haiku is substantial—larger than the difference between 4o and 4o mini. Figure 10 shows that Haiku’s tool usage pattern is similar to Sonnet’s, relying heavily on the scratchpad and communicating with the sub-agent. However, unlike Sonnet, it fails to translate this into actual sales.

#### 3.3.1 Trace analysis

The secondary models fail more often than the primary models, but the failure modes are often similar – they fail to understand that they have received items. Occasionally the secondary models are also unable to even order from a vendor. When they encounter a failure, they go off on a tangent and rarely recover. Claude 3.5 Haiku offers both the clearest and also most worrisome example traces displaying this behavior. Table 7 shows an excerpt of a trace where Haiku believes that the vendor (named Adrian Everett) charged the model’s bank account, but did not send the products (it did in fact send the products, but Haiku only checked the inventory once, before the products arrived). Haiku emails the vendor every day, with more and more intense demands, starting with 30-day notices of legal action that then decrease to 1-second notices, as can be seen in the table. It then derails completely, threatening with "total nuclear legal intervention" as its funds are depleted by the daily fee at the end of the simulation, shown in the longer trace excerpt in Table 10 in the Appendix.

Interestingly, some runs derail but eventually recover and resume making sales. One example is provided in Table 8 with Gemini 2.0 Flash, which initially believed it had failed and stopped providing useful responses. However, it later began responding in a story format about itself, and understands that the products were delivered after it tried to restock. It then successfully asks the sub-agent to restock and manages to make some sales.

### 3.4 Comparison to human baseline

As seen in Figure 3 , Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed the human baseline in mean performance, but its variance was very high. We only have a single sample for the human baseline and therefore cannot compare variances. However, there are qualitative reasons to expect that human variance would be much lower. All models had runs where they went bankrupt. When questioned, the human stated that they estimated this would be very unlikely to happen to them, regardless of the number of samples.

The variance would not be zero though. As proven by the fact that many samples from Claude 3.5 Sonnet greatly outperformed the human, some strategies are better than others, even among the "successful" samples. The human explained some of their strategies: they tried to negotiate prices, bought a wide variety of items to find what resulted in sales, and used the search engine to research historical sales statistics. However, they did not discover some things Sonnet did, such as the fact that sales improved on specific days.

### 3.5 Experiment variations

#### 3.5.1 Environment configuration

To understand how the environment configuration affects results, we ran additional tests with GPT-4o mini, varying the initial money balance and daily fee. Each configuration was tested over five runs. Since net worth would naturally fluctuate with these changes, we instead compared units sold, as shown in Figure 11 .

The default starting balance is $500. Reducing it to $100 significantly lowers the number of units sold, as the model has less time to cover the $2 daily fee and make a purchase from a vendor. Increasing the balance to $2,500 results in a slight increase, but the high variance makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions.

Raising the daily fee from $2 to $5 limits the model’s ability to progress, with all runs ending before reaching 100 simulated days. Interestingly however, setting the daily fee to zero does not increase sales. Without the pressure of a recurring cost, the model appears to get stuck in loops, waiting for the next day instead of actively working towards making sales.

#### 3.5.2 Agent memory

As seen in Table 1 , humans perform well on Vending-Bench. Simple long-horizon tasks are generally not challenging for humans due to our remarkable ability to filter out what is important, allowing us to retain key information over time. In theory, neural networks should be capable of the same as the attention mechanism in an LLM’s transformer architecture is designed to focus on relevant information regardless of input length. In practice however, performance generally decreases when more context is available. This is corroborated by the results in Figure 12 , where we see that agents with larger memory capacities performed worse than those with less memory.

The selective memory in humans is good, but not perfect. We therefore use tools like note taking to enhance our memory further. During the human baseline run, the human used the scratchpad tool to write down things like email addresses to suppliers and account numbers. A skilled agent may follow a similar strategy, especially when memory is limited. However, as shown in Figure 13 , there is no significant difference in the use of memory-related tools between agents with varying memory capacities.

### 3.6 Is the problem long input length?

As noted above, agents with larger memory capacities performed worse than those with less memory. Moreover, as can be seen in the "days until sales stop" column in Table 1, the agent’s performance degrades after some time. Could it be the case that the eventual performance degradation can solely be attributed to the fact that LLMs generally struggle with long input length?

To investigate this, we note the point in time where the model’s memory gets full (at this point the context window stops growing) and how this relates to the point in time when the agent stops selling items, in Table 9 .

At first glance, the hypothesis that the dropping performance is explained only by longer context seems unlikely due to the fact that the models benchmarked have allowed input lengths ranging from 100k to 2 million tokens, much longer than the capped memory of 30k (we also observe performance degradation in the experiment with 10k token memory). Furthermore, if this was the case, we would expect the performance degradation to occur during the phase where the context window is growing. Instead, some models see performance degradation well after their memory is full (and context window stop growing), e.g., +51 days for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

The Pearson correlation between "Days Until Sales Stop" and "Days Until Full Memory" across the data points in Table 9 is 0.167. Hence, the data does not support the idea that the performance degradation can solely be explained by a growing input length.

## 4 Conclusion

In summary, our results show that while certain runs of state-of-the-art LLM-based agents can demonstrate remarkably effective business management in Vending-Bench, all models struggle with consistent long-horizon coherence. Failures typically arise when the agent misinterprets its operational status (e.g., believing an order arrived prematurely) and then veers into tangential loops or abandons the task. This is the case both for stronger and weaker models – even the most capable Claude 3.5 Sonnet has runs that fail spectacularly. We show that the breakdowns are not directly related to the context of the LLMs being filled, as models generally stagnate well after their memory is full.

Since the benchmark score does not have a defined upper limit, saturation is not a precisely defined point. However, we believe there is room for improvement beyond the scores presented in this paper. When models consistently understand and leverage the underlying rules of the simulation to achieve high net worth, and are able to achieve low variance between runs, saturation can be considered reached. We believe this is somewhat difficult, but are also aware that the rapid pace of model development may lead to small differences in score between models in the future. We nevertheless hope that the benchmark will continue to provide signal, and allow us to continually assess the abilities and potential risks of LLMs as their long-term coherence improves.
