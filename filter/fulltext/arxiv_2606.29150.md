# Flow Reasoning Models: Turning Flows Into Efficient Recurrent Reasoners

Abstract
Structured reasoning requires making and revising interdependent decisions to
reach a globally consistent solution. Existing architectures struggle with this: au-
toregressive models commit sequentially and cannot revise earlier decisions, while
masked diffusion models often require careful decoding schemes to coordinate
interdependent predictions. We introduce Flow Reasoning Models (FRMs), a novel
framework for structured reasoning that adapts continuous flows over discrete struc-
tured outputs with a simple recurrent refinement mechanism. By self-conditioning
a flow model on its own past outputs, we turn one-shot denoising into iterative
solution refinement. This lets FRMs make and revise decisions in parallel, effi-
ciently coordinating interdependent choices across solutions. Yet conventional
self-conditioning becomes unreliable at greater recurrent depth due to exposure bias
between one-step training predictions and recursively generated inference states.
We address this mismatch with Fixed-Point Forcing (FPF), which trains FRMs on
states produced by their own inference dynamics while preserving the standard
flow-matching objective. FRMs achieve solve rates of 99.5%, 100.0%, and 99.9%
on Sudoku-Extreme, Zebra, and Maze-Unique, respectively. On Sudoku-Extreme,
FRMs achieve higher peak accuracy than the evaluated masked-diffusion and spe-
cialized reasoning baselines while remaining highly compute-efficient, matching
the next-best method’s98.7%peak solve rate with44×fewer inference FLOPs.
1 Introduction
A central challenge in structured reasoning is coordinating many mutually constraining decisions
into a single consistent solution. Autoregressive models often struggle with such tasks because they
commit to tokens in a fixed order, without the ability to later revise them as their global consequences
become clear. Masked diffusion models (Sahoo et al., 2024) offer a flexible generation order and
predict multiple tokens in parallel, but tokens updated within the same step are conditionally indepen-
dent given the current state and cannot condition on one another’s realized values, making aggressive
parallel updates prone to inconsistencies (Kim et al., 2025). Tightly constrained problems therefore
require many conservative updates, and correcting earlier errors requires additional mechanisms such
as remasking (Wang et al., 2026).
Continuous flow models over discrete data offer a promising alternative, modeling all tokens and their
interdependencies simultaneously. Recent work has demonstrated that continuous flow models can
effectively perform unconditional generation of natural language (Lee et al., 2026; Hu et al., 2026),
but their ability to perform structured reasoning remains largely unexplored. Indeed, in our own
experiments, a naive application of such continuous flows to structured reasoning tasks like Sudoku
solves only approximately13%on the Sudoku-Extreme benchmark (Wang et al., 2025a).

Figure 1:Flow Reasoning Models turn stable recurrent dynamics into efficient reasoning.Left:
a conceptual view of the recurrent solution landscape. Error states occupy unstable basins, while the
correct solution forms a stable attractor that recurrent sampling converges toward. Right: solve rate
versus inference FLOPs on Sudoku-Extreme. At the highlighted matched solve rate, FRM uses 44×
fewer FLOPs than the comparison method. The landscape is an explanatory schematic rather than a
literal three-dimensional embedding of model states.
We introduce Flow Reasoning Models (FRMs), which turn continuous flows over discrete outputs into
recurrent reasoning models that iteratively refine candidate solutions. Self-conditioning has previously
been used to improve unconditional generation (Chen et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2026). We observe that
it can be particularly useful for decomposing complex reasoning into successive refinement steps:
FRMs feed each prediction back into the flow as the state to be refined at the next step. This yields an
interpretable recurrent state that can be directly decoded into the model’s current candidate solution.
It also provides a training-efficient form of recurrence that requires no backpropagation through
time and retains the canonical flow-matching objective. Adding self-conditioning alone significantly
improves performance, raising the solve rate on Sudoku-Extreme from roughly 13% to 33%, but still
leaving most problems unsolved.
This limitation becomes clearer through a dynamical-systems interpretation of FRMs: recurrent
refinement performs learned fixed-point iteration over candidate solutions. Under this view, correct
solutions should form stable, error-correcting attractors, while incorrect states should remain transient.
Conventional self-conditioning fails to produce these dynamics on challenging problems, instead
converging to confidently incorrect fixed points. We trace this failure to exposure bias between the
one-step conditioning states used during training and the recursively generated states encountered
during inference (Bengio et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2025). We introduce Fixed-Point Forcing (FPF),
which trains on rollout-derived conditioning states so that the model learns to correct states produced
by its own dynamics. Our results support this attractor picture: under FPF, recurrent refinement
moves predictions toward the ground truth, correct solutions converge while incorrect states remain
dynamically active, and convergence becomes strongly predictive of correctness.
Our core contributions are as follows:
1. Flow Reasoning Models (FRMs), a novel generative modeling framework that turns con-
tinuous flows over discrete structured outputs into recurrent models for reasoning.Their
predictions form an interpretable, directly decodable reasoning state while the models retain the
canonical flow-matching objective and require no backpropagation through time.
2. Fixed-Point Forcing (FPF), a novel training method for recurrent self-conditioned flow
models.We discover that exposure bias can cause these models to converge to spurious fixed
points. FPF mitigates this mismatch by training on rollout-derived conditioning states, making
additional recurrent depth productive and convergence predictive of correctness.
3. State-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency across structured reasoning tasks.Across Sudoku-
Extreme, Maze, and Zebra, FRMs achieve state-of-the-art solve rates and compare favorably
with masked diffusion models and specialized small reasoning models in accuracy and inference
efficiency. On Sudoku-Extreme, FRMs reach a peak solve rate of 99.5% and match EqR’s peak
98.7%solve rate (Huang et al., 2026) with44×fewer inference FLOPs (Figure 1).

the fixed clues (gray), we decode the FRM’s prediction after each recurrent attempt, with incorrect
entries shown in red. The rollout illustrates how recurrent computation revises globally inconsistent
early predictions rather than committing to them permanently.
2 Flow Reasoning Models
2.1 Discrete Flows for Conditional Reasoning
We formulate reasoning as conditional generation over data pairs (c,y)∼p data. Here c denotes
the observed problem specification, for example, the given clues in Sudoku or the maze layout,
andy= (y 1,...,y L) denotes its discrete solution over vocabularyV. Only the solution is noised
and generated: c is supplied as a separate conditioning input and held fixed throughout training
and inference. Following work that models discrete data through continuous or simplex-valued
representations (Austin et al., 2021; Gat et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Stark et al., 2024), we encode
yas a one-hot endpointx 1∈{0,1} L×|V| and decode predictions by positionwise argmax.
Flow matching connects Gaussian noiseε∼N(0,I) to this endpoint along a probability path (Lip-
man et al., 2023; Albergo et al., 2025). We use the linear interpolant
xt = (1−t)ε+tx 1, t∈[0,1].(1)
We adopt the categorical clean-prediction parameterization of Flow Language Models (Lee et al.,
2026): a denoiserDt
θ(xt|c) predicts a categorical distribution over the clean token at each position.
The corresponding clean endpoint prediction determines the probability-flow velocity:
vt
θ(xt|c) =
 
Dt
θ(xt|c)−x t

/(1−t).(2)
The same output is therefore both a directly decodable candidate solution and the quantity used to
advance the flow. We train it with tokenwise cross-entropy,
LCE(θ) =E t,c,y,ε

.(3)
This standard discrete-flow model is our FLM baseline. On its own it leaves a substantial gap on
structured reasoning; FRMs add a recurrent axis while retaining this path and objective.
2.2 Self-Conditioning as Recurrent Reasoning
Self-conditioning.Self-conditioning augments a denoiser with its own previous output as an
additional input (Chen et al., 2023). We write the resulting model asDt
θ(xt|c,s) , wheres carries a
previous clean-solution prediction ands=∅ denotes a zero-valued null carry. Conventional training
uses two passes: a null-carry pass produces the detached prediction es= stopgrad[Dt
θ(xt|c,∅)] ,
and the supervised pass receives eitheresor the null carry. The probability path and endpoint loss in
Eq. (3) remain unchanged, and gradients do not pass throughes.
Self-conditioning creates recurrence.At inference, FRMs repeatedly feed the latest clean predic-
tion back throughs. This feedback lets later evaluations preserve useful decisions, revise inconsistent
ones, and correct earlier mistakes. It also creates a discrete reasoning depth k, separate from
continuous flow timet. Holding(x t,t)fixed, recurrent refinement is
s(0)
t =∅, s (k+1)
t =D t
θ(xt|c,s (k)
t ),(4)
so each carry directly estimates the same clean solution. This gives every update direct supervision,
allowing detached training without backpropagation through time. A sampler can alternate between
advancing the flow state xt and applying additional recurrent updates at the current flow time.
Although self-conditioning substantially improves refinement, its gains saturate with depth on
Sudoku-Extreme (Fig. 6b), motivating the fixed-point analysis and training method developed next.

Stopgrad
(a) Conventional self-conditioning
Stopgrad (b) Fixed-Point Forcing
Figure 3:Fixed-Point Forcing replaces one-pass carries with rollout-derived carries.Conven-
tional self-conditioning forms a detached carry with one denoiser pass at the supervised interpolant.
Fixed-Point Forcing instead forms the detached carry through repeated application of the denoiser,
exposing the loss-bearing update to a state produced by the model’s recurrent inference dynamics.
3 Fixed-Point Forcing Promotes Correct Solutions as Stable Attractors
The recurrence in Eq. (4) defines a dynamical system over candidate solutions. Fixing (xt,c,t) ,
repeated application ofDt
θ performs fixed-point iteration over the self-conditioning state. During an
FPF rollout, however, the flow state, time, and carry evolve jointly, so this fixed-point iteration is a
held-state view rather than a literal description of how the FPF carry is constructed. Flow time moves
through a family of denoising problems, while reasoning depth iterates the corresponding denoiser
toward a stable prediction. For a problemcwith goaly ⋆, the desired held-state behavior is
s(k)
t −→s⋆
t, D t
θ(xt|c,s ⋆
t ) =s ⋆
t,decode(s ⋆
t ) =y ⋆.(5)
A useful solution should be attracting: imperfect nearby states should move toward it under additional
reasoning depth. Stable states that decode to incorrect solutions are insteadspurious fixed points.
This perspective supplies a common language for the rest of the paper: training determines the
recurrent state distribution, inference probes the resulting closed-loop dynamics, and useful test-time
computation requires those dynamics to correct rather than stabilize errors.
3.1 Exposure Bias in the Recurrent State
Conventional self-conditioning trains with a detached one-pass carry produced from the ground-truth-
derived interpolantxt = (1−t)ε+ty , withes= stopgrad[Dt
θ(xt|c,∅)] (Fig. 4, left). Recurrent
inference instead feeds predictions back repeatedly, so the carry at depthk is generated by the model’s
own closed-loop dynamics rather than by one pass from a ground-truth-derived state. Training and
inference therefore induce different carry distributions,
ptrain(s|x t,c,t)̸=p (k)
infer(s|bxt,c,t),(6)
and the mismatch grows with depth.
This mismatch has two coupled effects. First, the denoiser is not calibrated for its own recurrent
states: an incorrect but overconfident prediction can be fed back as reliable evidence, amplify its error,
and settle at a spurious fixed point. Second, one-pass training rarely presents the subtle, low-residual
errors that remain after several refinement steps, so the model is not trained to correct precisely the
states encountered near convergence. On challenging problems, recurrence can therefore stabilize
and sharpen an incorrect solution, increasing gold-target cross-entropy with depth (Fig. 6).
3.2 Fixed-Point Forcing
Fixed-Point Forcing (FPF) replaces the one-pass carry used in conventional self-conditioning with
a detached carry produced by the model’s own multi-step inference dynamics. It thereby trains
each recurrent update on the kinds of states produced by earlier updates, directly targeting the
train–inference mismatch in Eq. (6).

Figure 4:Conventional self-conditioning and Fixed-Point Forcing training.Both procedures
supervise the same canonical interpolant. Conventional self-conditioning obtains its carry from one
pass at that interpolant, whereas FPF obtains a detached carry from a recursive rollout whose start
time is sampled uniformly before the supervision time and whose endpoint is the supervision time
itself. The self_conditioned_rollout helper denotes the standard self-conditioned integration
loop used at inference and for constructing the FPF carry.
The conceptual difference is illustrated in Fig. 3, and the corresponding training-code change is shown
in Fig. 4. We construct the FPF conditioning state by sampling a supervision time t and a rollout
starttstart∼U(0,t) , then run the inference-time self-conditioned integrator fromtstart tot. Its final
predictionsFPF is detached and supplied to the loss-bearing predictionDt
θ(xt|c,stopgrad(s FPF));
gradients do not pass through the rollout.
Crucially, this construction preserves the canonical flow-matching path exactly. As in conventional
self-conditioning, the loss-bearing input remainsxt = (1−t)ε+ty , the target remainsy, and the
endpoint cross-entropy is unchanged; the rollout prediction enters only through the self-conditioning
channel. FPF therefore changes the distribution of what the denoiser conditions on, not the state at
which the flow objective is supervised. Training on rollout-derived carries reduces the carry-side
exposure bias and the resulting overconfidence and miscalibration, while deeper rollout states expose
the model to the smaller, subtler residual errors that remain near convergence and train the local
corrections needed around a fixed point.
4 Experiments
We evaluate Flow Reasoning Models (FRMs) on Sudoku-Extreme, Zebra, and Maze-Unique, three
structured-prediction benchmarks with different constraints and output structures. Our primary metric
is exact solve rate. We compare inference efficiency using total FLOPs per instance and report the
number of function evaluations (NFE) to describe how each method allocates iterative computation.
Full protocols, baseline provenance, compute accounting, sweeps, and dynamics diagnostics appear
in Appendices A.1–C.
4.1 Accuracy and Efficiency Across Structured Reasoning Tasks
Flow Reasoning Models achieve near-perfect exact solving across distinct reasoning domains.
FRMs reach peak solve rates of 99.5% on Sudoku-Extreme, 100.0% on Zebra, and 99.9% on Maze-
Unique (Table 1). These benchmarks require constraint satisfaction, relational deduction, and path
finding, respectively, and differ substantially in sequence length, vocabulary, and output structure.
Near-perfect performance across all three therefore shows that recurrent flow refinement is not tied to
a particular task representation or constraint structure.
FRMs establish a stronger accuracy–compute frontier than diffusion language models and
specialized recurrent reasoners.FRM leads the measured accuracy–compute frontier on all three
tasks (Fig. 5). On Sudoku-Extreme, it attains the highest solve rate and reaches EqR’s 98.7% peak
with an estimated 44× fewer inference FLOPs. FRM likewise dominates the measured Maze-Unique
frontier, although its 99.9% peak is slightly below the best observed 100.0%, and reaches 100.0%
on Zebra, exceeding both reported peaks and the measured baselines. Zebra contains fewer curves

4.2 Self-Conditioning Enables Recurrent Refinement
Vanilla discrete flows achieve limited peak performance and do not scale with inference compute.
Across all three tasks, the vanilla FLM baselines plateau well below the full FRM (Table 2), and
allocating more forward passes leaves their solve-rate curves essentially flat. Additional integration
more accurately traces the learned probability path, but provides no mechanism for repeatedly revising
the current solution.
Self-conditioning enables recurrent refinement.Adding self-conditioning improves solve rate
over a plain discrete flow on Sudoku-Extreme ( 13.1%→32.6% ) and Maze-Unique ( 77.6%→
96.2%; Table 2). On Zebra, however, self-conditioning lowers the three-seed mean from 62.3%
to 36.9%, and both the base and self-conditioned flows exhibit high seed variance. Feeding each
prediction back to the model creates a recurrent computation that can preserve correct assignments
and revise earlier mistakes, as illustrated by the decoded trajectory in Fig. 2. On an easier Sudoku
variant introduced by Shah et al. (2024) (Sudoku-Shah), self-conditioning alone is already sufficient
to raise solve rate from approximately 30% to 99%, showing that recurrent refinement can saturate
less demanding constraint problems without Fixed-Point Forcing.

Figure 6:Fixed-Point Forcing aligns recurrent convergence with correctness on Sudoku-
Extreme.(a) Under conventional self-conditioning, gold-target loss increases with depth as pre-
dictions stabilize at incorrect fixed points; FPF instead drives loss toward zero by making correct
solutions attracting and spurious states unstable. (b) Consequently, FPF continues to improve solve
rate with additional NFE, whereas self-conditioning saturates. (c) The residual between adjacent
recurrent states becomes strongly predictive of correctness under FPF, indicating that the model
converges primarily on correct solutions. Under conventional self-conditioning, convergence can
instead occur at incorrect states.
Conventional self-conditioning remains unreliable at depth.Despite these gains, its Sudoku-
Extreme solve rate plateaus near one-third of puzzles as recurrent depth increases (Fig. 6b), motivating
a training procedure that makes the recurrent computation reliable over long rollouts.
4.3 Fixed-Point Forcing Creates Healthy Reasoning Dynamics
Exposure bias produces confidently incorrect fixed points.With conventional self-conditioning,
solve rate plateaus as recurrent depth increases while gold-target cross-entropy grows even as
the adjacent-state symmetric-KL residual shrinks (Fig. 6a,b). The model is therefore not simply
failing to converge: it is becoming increasingly confident in self-consistent but incorrect predictions.
Correspondingly, residual magnitude is uninformative about correctness (AUROC0.50; Fig. 6c).
Fixed-Point Forcing mitigates exposure bias, enabling recurrent test-time scaling.Replacing
the one-pass training carry with a rollout-derived carry raises the three-seed mean solve rate from
32.6% to 99.2% on Sudoku-Extreme and from 96.2% to 98.0% on Maze-Unique. On Zebra, the
three FPF seeds average 99.9% (Table 2); the best evaluated operating points reach99.5% on Sudoku-
Extreme and 99.9% on Maze-Unique (Table 1). More importantly, conventional self-conditioning
plateaus with recurrent depth, whereas FPF continues converting additional model evaluations into
corrected solutions (Fig. 6b). Because FPF changes the training distribution of recurrent carries while
preserving the architecture, canonical flow path, and endpoint objective, the comparison isolates
exposure to inference-induced states as the intervention that unlocks recurrent test-time scaling.
Fixed-Point Forcing aligns convergence with correctness.Under FPF, additional recurrent up-
dates reduce gold-target cross-entropy as solve rate increases, directing convergent trajectories toward
the correct solution rather than merely toward a self-consistent prediction (Fig. 6a,b). We mea-
sure convergence by the token-averaged symmetric KL between adjacent predictive distributions,
rk =D SKL(pk,pk−1). This residual changes from a chance-level correctness signal under conven-
tional self-conditioning to a nearly perfect one under FPF (AUROC 1.00; Fig. 6c). Convergence thus
becomes an observable signature of successful reasoning, although not a formal certificate of correct-
ness. Together, these findings support the attractor picture in Fig. 1: conventional self-conditioning
admits stable incorrect fixed points, whereas FPF reshapes the closed-loop dynamics so that correct
solutions behave as stable, error-correcting attractors. The depicted basins summarize this empirical
dynamical behavior rather than asserting a literal low-dimensional geometry.

denoising (Sahoo et al., 2024). Shi et al. (2025) derive a simplified continuous-time objective as a
weighted integral of cross-entropy losses and generalize the framework to state-dependent masking
schedules. Within this family, Kim et al. (2025) use adaptive token ordering to allocate computation,
whereas Wang et al. (2025b) introduce remasking so earlier commitments can be revised; Duo instead
uses uniform categorical corruption, keeping every token revisable throughout sampling (Sahoo et al.,
2025). More recently, continuous flow language models have emerged as competitive alternatives.
FLM learns Gaussian-to-one-hot probability paths and FMLM distills them into few-step maps (Lee
et al., 2026), while LangFlow and ELF define flows in learned and contextual embedding spaces,
respectively (Chen et al., 2026; Hu et al., 2026). FRMs are inspired by this diffusion-and-flow
tradition, but use the clean denoiser prediction as a directly decodable recurrent state and train the
resulting closed loop for iterative solution refinement rather than treating repeated evaluations only as
steps of a generative sampler.
Recurrent and Fixed-Point Reasoning.Recent structured reasoners scale test-time computa-
tion through weight-tied recurrence. HRM uses hierarchical recurrent states (Wang et al., 2025a).
TRM (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2025) and PTRM (Sghaier et al., 2026) repeatedly update compact
answer and latent states. EqR explicitly trains solution-aligned attractor dynamics (Huang et al.,
2026). FPRM similarly observes that convergence becomes predictive of correctness and uses this
signal for adaptive halting (Movahedi et al., 2026). FRMs share the emphasis on recurrent test-time
scaling, attractor dynamics, and meaningful convergence, but realize them within a self-conditioned
flow language model: the flow denoiser’s clean prediction is both the recurrent input and an explicit
solution candidate. Rather than introducing a bespoke latent-state architecture, FRM retains the stan-
dard non-causal Transformer and flow objective already demonstrated at language-model scale (Lee
et al., 2026; Hu et al., 2026), providing a natural path toward larger models and less specialized
domains. FPF further avoids backpropagation through the rollout: model-generated states enter only
through the conditioning channel, while every loss-bearing flow state remains on the target-derived
canonical path.
Learning from Model-Induced States.Conventional self-conditioning feeds a detached estimate
of the clean sample into later denoising steps, but trains that channel with a one-pass prediction rather
than the recursively generated predictions encountered during inference, as introduced for continuous
encodings of discrete data by Analog Bits (Chen et al., 2023). This is an instance of exposure bias:
the model is evaluated on its own induced context without being trained on that context (Ross et al.,
2011; Bengio et al., 2015). Concurrent work likewise frames self-conditioned flow language models
as fixed-point iterations for few-step generation (Yoo et al., 2026); we study structured reasoning
and training on model-induced recurrent states. Self Forcing closes the analogous context mismatch
in autoregressive video diffusion by training on self-generated rollout context (Huang et al., 2025).
FPF can be understood as a self-forcing variant specialized to the recurrent conditioning channel
of conditional discrete flows: it treats the carry, rather than previous frames, as model-generated
context. Unlike Self Forcing, FPF requires neither a sequence-level distribution-matching objective
nor differentiation through the rollout; it changes only the carry distribution while preserving the
canonical flow path and endpoint objective.
6 Discussion
Flow Reasoning Models indicate that discrete flows can be a powerful and efficient model class for
structured reasoning. Across constraint satisfaction, relational deduction, and path finding, FRMs
achieve strong performance while retaining a favorable accuracy–compute tradeoff. Conditioning
8

discrete flows on their own past predictions creates an iterative refinement process, while training on
recursively generated states with Fixed-Point Forcing dramatically improves performance and makes
additional recurrent depth productive. Together, these results suggest that recurrent reasoning need
not rely on a specialized recurrent architecture: it can emerge from the learned refinement dynamics
of a general-purpose generative model. Scaling this approach to larger models and less structured
tasks is an important direction for future work.

A Experimental Details
A.1 Datasets
Sudoku-Extreme.We use Sudoku-Extreme to test long-horizon constraint satisfaction on hard
9×9 puzzles that require extended chains of deduction and search. The benchmark was introduced
with the Hierarchical Reasoning Model as a small-data test of recurrent reasoning (Wang et al.,
2025a); we represent each released puzzle as its unique solution together with a mask that clamps the
given clues. For each training seed, we draw a difficulty-balanced subset of 1,000 puzzles from the
official training split and apply random Sudoku symmetries as augmentation. We select checkpoints
on a fixed held-out validation subset and report exact-grid solve rate on a fixed 1,000-puzzle subset
of the official test split.
Zebra.We use Zebra to test whether recurrent refinement transfers from grid-local constraints
to heterogeneous relational reasoning. Introduced as a reasoning benchmark by Shah et al. (2024),
the dataset contains approximately 1.5 million training and 0.1 million test instances spanning three
to six houses and attributes. Following the uniform 3×3 –6×6 mixture introduced by Shah et al.
(2024) and used by Kim et al. (2025), we train and evaluate across all four puzzle sizes rather than

restricting the benchmark to a fixed 5×5 slice. We retain each puzzle’s original clue serialization but
replace its variable, solver-ordered trace with a canonical attribute-by-house solution grid. We report
exact-grid solve rate on the mixed held-out split.
Maze-Unique.We use Maze-Unique to test structured path finding under an unambiguous exact-
solve criterion. Released with Equilibrium Reasoners (Huang et al., 2026), this 30×30 path-finding
benchmark provides official, revision-pinned splits of 1,000 training and 1,000 test mazes; we encode
walls, start, and goal as clamped cells and generate the remainder of the grid. We prefer it to the
more common Maze-Hard benchmark because every instance has a unique solution path, making
exact-grid accuracy coincide with path validity and optimality instead of penalizing an alternative
valid route. It also permits direct comparison with recent recurrent reasoners evaluated on the same
split.
A.2 Models and Training
All experiments use a non-causal DiT backbone and the categorical clean-prediction objective.
AdamW with β= (0.9,0.999) , gradient clipping at 1.0, EMA decay 0.9999, dropout 0.1, and a
constant learning-rate schedule are shared across datasets. The learning rate, weight decay, batch
size, warmup, training budget, and architecture vary by dataset and are reported in Table 3. In every
case, Stage A trains self-conditioning from scratch; Stage B initializes from the selected Stage-A
weights with a fresh optimizer and EMA state before applying FPF. For each training seed, we select
the checkpoint and inference configuration (including sampler and NFE) with the highest validation
solve rate. Table 2 aggregates the resulting selected operating points across seeds.
A.3 Baseline Provenance and Comparability
We organize baselines into three families because they make different architectural commitments.
The autoregressive baseline is a plain causal decoder-only transformer trained with teacher-forced
next-token cross-entropy over a clue-grid-then-solution-grid sequence: no denoising, no recurrence,
and no mechanism to revise an already-committed token, making it the naive baseline the rest of the
comparison is meant to contextualize (Shah et al., 2024). Diffusion language models and flows use a
general-purpose generative denoising formulation that can share the same non-causal DiT backbone
as FRM. Small recurrent reasoning models instead introduce task-oriented recurrent state, update,
or halting mechanisms. This grouping clarifies the role of each comparison; it does not by itself
imply matched capacity or compute, so Table 1 reports the model size used on each benchmark and
Appendix A.4 reports inference cost.
12

Accuracy provenance.Unless noted here, entries in Table 1 are measurements from our evaluation
harness using checkpoints that we trained or official checkpoints that we evaluated. For Zebra,
the FMLM, FLM, and FRM entries are our measurements. The daggered MDLM and adaptive-
MDLM accuracies are published values from Kim et al. (2025) on Shah’s uniform 3×3 –6×6
mixture; we could not reproduce those reported accuracies in our pipeline. Our weight-backed Zebra
MDLM reproduction peaks at 49.2% under our shorter training budget and supplies the measured
operating points used for efficiency analysis. We omit ReMDM and specialized recurrent reasoners
on Zebra because we did not obtain a reliable result under the same mixed protocol; the dashes
therefore indicate unavailable comparisons, not zero accuracy. For Maze-Unique, EqR is a published
reference value, whereas TRM is our 0.264M-parameter reproduction trained and evaluated on the
Maze-Unique split, reaching 77.9% exact solve rate. The 44.9% result reported by the original TRM
work is for Maze-Hard, not Maze-Unique, and is therefore excluded from this table. The remaining
Maze-Unique entries are measured from our trained reproductions or evaluated checkpoints. Thus,
published accuracies support the headline comparison, whereas every point in an accuracy–compute
frontier is produced from a checkpoint available to our profiler.
A.4 Inference Compute Accounting
Number of function evaluations.We report the realized number of learned-model evaluations
required to solve one puzzle. For our Euler, SDE, and held-time samplers, NFE counts every iterative
update and the final readout evaluation; for methods with adaptive stopping, branching, or breadth,
we count all evaluations actually executed for that instance. NFE exposes the number of sequential
model calls and is easy to reproduce, but it is not a sufficient cross-method compute measure: one
evaluation can differ substantially in cost across architectures, sequence lengths, model sizes, and
internally recurrent networks. The appendix table reportssolved-puzzle mean NFE: for each puzzle
that is solved at some point along its evaluated trajectory, we record the first NFE at which it is solved
and average over solved puzzles only. This is an oracle trajectory diagnostic unless correctness can
be detected without access to the ground truth; it should therefore not be interpreted as deployable
early stopping for every method.
Floating-point operations.We therefore use total FLOPs per puzzle as the primary hardware-
independent compute measure. We profile an actual batch-one forward pass with PyTorch’s operator-
level FLOP counter, disabling fused attention so that its matrix multiplications are visible, and
multiply the measured per-evaluation cost by the realized NFE; methods with nonuniform calls are
profiled and summed by call type. This quantity should be interpreted as a lower bound on the work
required to solve an instance: it counts floating-point arithmetic but not memory traffic, kernel-launch
and framework overhead, control flow, communication, or data movement. We therefore present the
full accuracy–compute frontiers rather than compressing each method to a single operating-point
ratio.
B Additional Accuracy and Ablation Results
This section documents the headline accuracy–compute comparison and training-recipe ablation;
Appendix A gives datasets, checkpoint provenance, and FLOP accounting.
B.1 Accuracy–Compute Evaluation
Each frontier contains measured operating points only. We vary each checkpoint’s native compute
control and charge every learned-model call. Fixed-depth methods use the requested depth; adaptive
methods use realized mean computation. We neither extrapolate unsupported method–dataset pairs
nor include published accuracies lacking a compatible profiled checkpoint, although those values
may still appear in Table 1.

Adaptive computation.Token-adaptive methods can incur a nonzero minimum cost even at their
lowest nominal setting. We therefore plot measured realized FLOPs rather than the maximum-step
label.
B.2 Training-Recipe Results
Table 2 reports three-seed means and standard deviations for every dataset. We report aggregate
statistics consistently and omit individual-seed values.
C Additional Dynamics Analysis
We distinguish productive refinement from convergence to an incorrect fixed point using the following
depth-dependent diagnostics.
Depth-dependent performance and distance to the solution.At each depth, we record exact
solve rate and token-averaged cross-entropy to the one-hot solution on the same pinned examples.
Thus changes isolate additional recurrent computation. In Fig. 6, FPF improves accuracy while
driving ground-truth loss downward; conventional self-conditioning becomes increasingly confident
in incorrect states.
Convergence residual and correctness prediction.For adjacent distributions pk andpk−1, we
measure the token-averaged symmetric-KL residual rk =D SKL(pk,pk−1) and pair it with the
decoded state’s exact-solve label. A near-zero residual indicates convergence, not necessarily
correctness. Conventional self-conditioning yields chance-level discrimination (AUROC 0.50); under
FPF, convergence is strongly predictive of correctness (AUROC1.00) on Sudoku-Extreme.
Interpretation.Exact solve rate remains primary; loss-to-gold and adjacent-state residuals reveal
whether depth corrects the solution or settles into a confidently incorrect fixed point.
