Abstract 
The intricate interplay between an organism's brain, body, and environment fundamentally 
shapes its behavior. Existing detailed models focusing on either the brain or the body-environment 
separately. A complete model that bridges these two components is yet to be developed. Here, we 
present MetaWorm, a data-driven model of a widely studied organism, C. elegans . This model 
consists of two sub-models: the brain model and the body & environment model. The brain model 
was built by multi- compartment models with realistic morphology, connectome,  and neural 
population dynamics based on experimental data. Simultaneously, the body & environment model 
employed a lifelike body and a 3D physical environment, facilitating easy behavior quantification. 
Through the closed- loop interaction between two  sub-models, MetaWorm faithfully reproduce d 
the realistic zigzag movement towards attractors observed in C. elegans. Moreover, leveraging this 
model, we investigate d the impact of neural system structure on both neural activities  and 
behaviors. Consequently, MetaWorm can enhance our understanding of how the brain controls the 
body to interact with its surrounding environment.  
 
Introduction 
The behaviors of an animal are not simply the product of brain activity but rather, emerge from 
a dynamic interplay among the brain, body, and environment. To study neural control mechanisms, 
it is crucial to build  a complete s imulation that incorporating detailed models of the  brain, body 
and environment , to both validate theories and make predictions for biological experiments. 
Currently, there are specific models that simulate either the brain, e.g., the mouse primary visual 
cortex1, the mouse striatum 2, and the rat somatosensory cortex 3, or  exclusively the body and 
environment to reproduce animal behaviors, such as neuromechanical models for Drosophila4 and 
rodent5. OpenWorm project6 aimed to simulate C. elegans  years ago,  despite its detailed brain 
model and body model worked  separately. So far, no complete model exists that successfully 
bridges these elements, although such integration is urgently needed to progress our understanding

of neural control mechanisms7. 
Specifically, a complete model must meet certain  requirements. First, it should incorporate a 
biophysically detailed brain model that has similar neural structures and neural activity patterns as 
real organism. Secondly, it should consist of a body and environment model, which is realistic, 
high-performance, and easy for behavior quantification. Thirdly, the brain model should not only 
control the body model interacting with the virtual environment, but also get the feedback from 
the body and environment model, achieving a closed-loop interaction8,9.  
C. elegans stands out as an exemplary model for developing such a complete model that bridges 
brain, body and environment. It has completely mapped morphologies of all 302 neurons10,11 (in 
adult hermaphrodite), along with the connectome and synapse-level structure12-14. Recordings of 
single neural activity15-23, as well as brain -wide neural dynamics18,20,24 are available. Its body is 
simple yet well- reconstructed, consisting of only 95 muscle cells. It also  exhibits easily 
quantifiable behaviors, such as crawling, swimming, foraging, and various social behaviors 25,26. 
Therefore, these simple structures and abundant data provide significant advantages for creating a 
complete model. 
In this study, we present a complete data-driven model of C. elegans, MetaWorm (Fig. 1). First, 
we developed a neural network model (brain model) of a C. elegans foraging neural circuit. It was 
built using biophysically detailed compartmental neuronal models, with compartments under 2 μm 
in length, encoding neural activity similar to live C. elegans . Second, we developed a body & 
environment model of C. elegans. The body model contained  96 muscles and enabled efficient 
real-time simulation at 30 frames per second and easy quanti fication of behaviors. Third, we 
established a closed-loop interaction between the brain model and the body-environment model to 
simulate C. elegans moving towards an attractor in a zig-zag shape. Sensory neurons in the neural 
network model were activated by attractor’s concentration in environment . Muscles in the body 
model were controlled by motor neurons in  the neural network model. Finally, we performed 
synthetic perturbations on the neural network model and suggested that neurite or synaptic/gap 
junction' absence disrupts global neural dynamics and hampers accurate forward motion. This 
highlights the importance  of network structure in shaping both network dynamics and behavior 
patterns.  
Undoubtedly, MetaWorm will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships 
between neural structures , neural activities, and behaviors. This work also provides a valuable  
framework for developing brain-body-environment model of other organisms. This innovative 
approach paves the way for new avenues of systems biology and has the potential to revolutionize 
traditional neural mechanism research.  
 
Results 
Constructing a data-driven biophysically detailed neural network model of C. elegans 
Our neural network model of C. elegans contained 136 neurons that participated in sensory and 
locomotion functions, as indicated by published studies 24,27-31. To construct this model, we first 
collected the necessary data including neural morphology, ion channel models, electrophysiology 
of single neurons, connectome, connection models and network activities  (Fig. 2A). Next, we 
constructed the individual neuron models and their connections (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, a 
biophysically detailed model without functions was established (Fig. 2C). Finally, we optimized

the weights and polarit ies of the connections to obtain  a model that reflected realistic dynamics 
(Fig. 2D). An overview of the model construction is illustrated in Figure 2.  
To achieve a high level of biophysical and morphological realism in our model, we employed 
multi-compartment models to represent individual neurons. The morphologies of neuron models 
were constructed based on published morphological data 32,33. S oma and neurite sections were 
further divided into several segments , where each segment was  less than 2 μm  in length. We 
combined 14 known classes of ion channels ( Supplementary Table S1-2)34 in neuron models, and 
tuned the passive parameters and ion channel conductance densities  by an optimization 
algorithm35 to reproduced electrophysiological traces  in the experiments36-39. Based on the few 
available electrophysiological data, w e digitally reconstructed models of five representative 
neurons: AWC, AIY , A V A, RIM and VD5. The I-V curves of our neuron models  perfectly match 
that in the experiment s (Fig. 3) . The optimized parameters of neur on models are listed in 
Supplementary Table S3. 
These five neurons are representative for  five different functional group: sensory neuron, 
interneuron, command neuron, head motor neuron and body motor neuron. They serve as the 
initial pool of digital neuron models to reconstruct other neurons in the neural network model. For 
neurons that are not representative neurons, their biophysical parameters were set the same as the 
representative neuron models that belonged to the same functional group. The referenced neurons 
of all neurons  are listed in Supplementary Table S4. This approach allows us to achieve a high 
level of biophysical and morphological realism in our C. elegans  neural network model with  
limited accessible experimental data. 
For connections, we first modeled gap junctions as simple ohmic resistances, and synapses as 
continuously transmitting synapse , according to  published models32,40-43. Then, we developed an 
algorithm to determine the number and locations of  connections. The number of connections 
between two cells was from  the cell adjacency matrix 10,11 (Fig. 4 A). For each connection, we 
randomly assigned a distance following the neurite centroids distance distributions of synapse/gap 
junction in experiment 13 (Fig. 4 B). Each connection linked  two segments whose  distance was 
closest to the randomly assigned distance. This approach allowed us to generate connections that 
were constrained by experimental connection numbers and distance distributions (Fig. 4C). Figure 
4D-F show some examples of the connections between neurons  in our neural network model. 
Most synapses and gap junctions were located on neurites that were relatively close to each other. 
Also, as shown in Fig. 4 F, the constructed connections tended to cluster together, which followed 
the clustered organization principle in published research13,14. 
To determine the polarities of synapses  (excitatory or inhibitory) and the connection weight s, 
we employed a gradient -descend-based algorithm  to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) 
between simulation results and the optimization target. In this study, our optimization target was a 
Pearson correlation matrix of 65 identified neurons in a prior study 24, where activity series were 
recorded through whole -brain single -cell-resolution Ca 2+ imaging. Figure 5A illustrates the 
correlation matrices generated from our simulation and the experimental data. These two maps 
exhibited similar correlation strengths, whose mean squared error was only 0.076. 
To further analyze the optimized neural network model, w e conducted principal components 
analysis (PCA) on the membrane potential of the 65 identified neurons, involving the calculation 
of principal components (PCs) based on the covariance structure in the normalized data (Fig. 5B). 
Our analysis unveiled that PC1 exhibits an opposite dynamic to that of PC2 (Fig. 5C). Upon

sorting based on PC1, most neurons controlling forward locomotion (e.g., A VB, VB, DB neurons) 
and backward locomotion (e.g., A V A, V A, DA neurons) were distinctly classified into two groups 
(Fig. 5B). Th is indicates  that our neural network model accurately captures realistic neural 
dynamical relationships, and the dynamics of neurons encode functions similar to those observed 
in real C. elegans, to some extent. 
 
Constructing a high-performance body & environment model of C. elegans 
Next, we developed the body & environment model  of the C. elegans . Our primary 
contributions are:  1) modelling the soft body , muscles, and solving soft body deformation, 2) 
creating the 3D simulation environment and solving soft body- fluid interaction , 3) proposed a 
novel reference coordinate system for behavior analysis. The framework of this model is 
illustrated in Figure 6A and B. 
The body model was built with tetrahedral mesh, including 984 vertices, 3341 tetrahedrons and 
1466 triangles on the body surface  (Fig. 6C). Also, it had four muscle strings: ventral right (VR), 
ventral left (VL), dorsal right (DR) and dorsal left (DL). Each string had 24 muscle cells arranged 
from head to tail ( Fig. 6D). Tetrahedrons were controlled by their near muscle strings. The 
corresponding strings were visualized with different color s in Figure 6E. We used Finite Element 
Method (FEM) solver to compute positions and velocities of all vertices on the deformable body 
at any given time. In the computation, the solver used 4558 muscle constraints and 3341 corotated 
elasticity constraints. Thus, our soft -body simulation engaged a sum of 7,899 mechanical 
constraints. After the geometry construction, we need to solve the body deformation efficiently. In 
our model, we selected a real-time, highly robust, and accura te approach named projective 
dynamics as the FEM solver for calculation. The solved body state was visualized in Fig.6F. 
We constructed a large 3D fluid simulation environment, where the body, foods were embedded. 
This environment was essentially a large cube, with each edge equating to approximately 1200 
times the length of a C. elegans. The mechanic of the body movement in fluid is essentially a soft 
body-fluid coupling problem. To simplify this problem, we only calculated  the thrust force (Fig. 
6G) and drag force (Fig. 6H) on the body surface44. This simplification allowed for the simulation 
of a much larger space and improved computational efficiency.  To achieve forward locomotion 
behavior, we used projective dynamics to calculate real-time bending waves that propagated from 
head to tail. The interaction between these bending waves and the fluid  generated impetus for 
forward locomotion (Fig.6I). 
C. elegans is an animal with soft body that exhibits special patterns during locomotion, wherein 
every point on its body oscillates continuously. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the trajectory 
and body state during locomotion. Here, we proposed an effective and simple method to measure 
C. elegans  locomotion. The  main idea  of this method is to establish a numerically stable 
coordinate system relative to the body itself, named T arget Body Reference Coordinate System 
(TBRCS) ( Fig. 7A) . First, we d efined the target body , standard body and Standard Body 
Coordinate System (SBCS). Then, we computed transformation M between the target body and 
the standard body. Finally, we used M to perform three-dimensional transformation on the S BCS 
to obtain the TBRCS. Details of this method are described in Methods. Using this method, we can 
stably quantify not only the body’s locomotion trajectory ( Fig. 7A), but also the body state s 
including the relative position and velocities of any points on the C. elegans body (Fig. 7B and Fig. 
7C) and steering angle (Fig. 7D) . For example, figure 7E displays the relative positions of 17

sampled 3D tracking points, while Figure 7F illustrates their corresponding velocities.  In Figure 
7E, the swing direction of body was Z direction of the TBRCS (dorsal-ventral direction). Also, 
there was a spring movement in X direction of the TBRCS (head-tail direction) during forward 
locomotion. Locomotion in Y direction of the TBRCS  (left-right direction) wa s nearly flat since 
muscle activations were approximately symmetric in this direction. Figure 7F shows that, in this 
case, the primary propulsion of forward locomotion originated from tail (pink line), since speed 
represented power. Moreover, our method enables the quantification of the body's steering. Figure 
7D shows an example of a steering angle θ, which was defined as the angle  between TBRCS x-
axis and the direction of velocity. The steering angle θ was also numerically stable. 
In summary, our body model is simple yet preserving anatomical authenticity. Our environment 
model provides a large -scale 3D scene for simulations. Our simulation is real- time and  allows 
simulations of C. elegans  populations. Importantly, our model  facilitates easy quantification of 
behaviors. 
 
Replicating locomotion behavior of C. elegans 
In our complete model, we successfully replicated the locomotion behavior of C. elegans by a 
closed-loop interaction between the neural network model and the body & environment model. 
Specifically, the neural network model sensed the dynamic food concentration in the environment 
by sensory neurons. This sensory information was used to calculate the membrane potentials of 
motor neurons . T he membrane potentials of motor neurons  were subsequently translated into 
muscle activation signals, which controlled the movement of C. elegans' body to navigate towards 
the food in the environment. An overview of this closed-loop simulation is illustrated in Figure 8A. 
Notably, w e observed that the trajectory of the C. elegans  movement in our model closely 
resembled the trajectory recorded in the experiments45, with both exhibiting a zigzag pattern (Fig. 
8B). Additionally, C. elegans  in both the simulation s (Supplementary Movie S1 and 
Supplementary Movie S2) and experiments exhibited a dorsoventral fluctuation during 3D 
movement46,47. 
Regarding sensation, w e assumed that the food concentration in the environment follows a  
linearly distribution . T o incorporate this sensory information into our model, we used the 
derivative of the food concentration as the amplitude of an external current injected into the soma 
of all sensory neurons. Regarding neuromuscular coupling, we employed a  linear transformation, 
treating the neural network model as a reservoir to generate muscle activities (Methods 3.6). 
During locomotion, the input of sensory neurons  exhibit ed fluctuations due to the zig -zag 
movement of the body’s head (Fig. 8C). The membrane potentials of each individual motor neuron 
also oscillated in response to the sensory input, especially the head motor neurons (Fig. 8D). The 
activation of muscle  cells reveal ed traveling waves from the head to the tail, accompanied by  
alternating contractions and relaxations of dorsal and ventral muscle cells  ( Fig. 8E) . These 
findings closely resemble observations in biological experiments48. To facilitate visualization, we 
have incorporated the locomotion of C. elegans, the activities of its neural network model, and 
muscle activities into our graphical user interface (GUI) (Fig. 9).  
In s ummary, our model successfully reproduced locomotion behavior in this closed -loop 
simulation and facilitated the visualization and analysis of neuron dynamics, muscle activities, and 
behavioral patterns.

Exploring the impact of neural network structure on dynamics and behaviors 
We are interested in exploring the extent to which network structure influences the neural 
dynamics and behaviors, thus we conducted synthetic perturbations on the structure of our  neural 
network model. Synthetic perturbations of the neural system often exceed individual tolerance 
level in animals . However, our model enables researchers to carry out experiments without 
concerns about experimental technique limitations or animal tolerance.  Based on MetaWorm, we 
performed experiments involving synthetic perturbations to quantitatively examine the impact of 
network structure on network dynamics and behaviors. 
In the absence of neurites, the body exhibits a higher degree of  twisting during locomotion, as 
indicated by the larger relative locations of tracking points on the head and tail compared to the  
control group. This suggests that neurites play a crucial role in the computations associated with 
network information processing (Fig. 10B). Moreover, shuffling connection locations within the 
model leads to faster oscillations of the head and tail but slower forward locomotion (Fig. 10C) . 
This suggests that the specific locations of connections along the neurites  are important, 
potentially facilitating local ized computations within neurons. Additionally, despite the neural 
network model contains fewer gap junctions than synapses, the role of gap junctions in C. elegans 
neural network appears to be  more important than that of synapses  (Fig. 10D- G), because 
perturbations on gap junctions result in more obvious changes in the  Pearson Correlation matrix 
compared to perturbations on synapses . Perturbations on gap junctions accelerate the twisting of 
the body compared to the control group, whereas perturbations on synapses result in slower 
twisting. These results emphasize the importance of network structure in shaping network 
dynamics and behavior patterns. By utilizing our model, researchers can gain valuable insights 
into the contributions of network structure to neural network. 
Discussion 
In this study , we present  MetaWorm, a complete model of C. elegans  that integrates detailed 
models of neural network, body and environment . The neural network model  of MetaWorm is 
highly detailed and  data-driven, capturing neural population activity patterns and encoding 
functions observed in real C. elegans. The body & environment model  of MetaWorm is realistic, 
efficient, and allows for the quantification of behaviors. Based on the interaction of these two sub-
models, w e achieved locomotion behavior in C. elegans . This represents the first time that a 
detailed complete model replays a behavior with motor control and sensory feedback.  
The neural network model of MetaWorm integrated experimental data including ion channel 
dynamics, neural morphologies, electrophysiology, connectome, synaptic organization rules on 
neurites, as well as neural activities . Although we collected and integrate d as much data as 
possible up until 2023, there remain ed a substantial amount of detail that could not be fully 
implemented due to lack of data. Also, the physical parameters in body & environment model did 
not correspond precisely to those of actual C. elegans , because they were difficult to measure  
accurately. However, with the influx of new experimental data, these models can be enhanced and 
refined. 
For the neuromechanical connection between these two sub-models, the neural network model 
served as a reservoir that processed data in a complex  and nonlinear way. The input was mapped 
onto an output linear layer to produce muscle activation. With only one linear readout layer, the 
neural network model successfully controlled the body’s locomotion. This demonstrates the great

information processing ability of our neural network model. 
When the input of the neural network model was a periodic standard signal, i.e. without sensory 
feedback from the environment, the membrane potentials of motor neurons and the activations of 
muscle cells were periodic (Supplementary Figure S1) . This resulted in the movement trajectory 
of the C. elegans  body following a standard Z- shape, which was extremely similar to the 
trajectory in the experiment 45,49 (Supplementary Figure S1B and Supplementary Movie S3). 
Conversely, When the input wa s a sensory signal dependent  on the body’s location in the 
environment ( Fig. 8 ), the input was not periodic, leading to non -periodic dynamics  in both 
neurons and muscle cells. Therefore, the trajectory of the body was not as regular as that observed 
in the experiment (Fig. 8B). Future studies will focus on designing  more reasonable Central 
Pattern Generators (CPGs) or motor control systems to achieve more realistic movement.  
MetaWorm serves as a white box model of C. elegans. Its two sub-models can be independently 
enhanced with the influx of new additional data from experimental studies. We  provide 
researchers with user-friendly interfaces to design their own model based on their experimental 
data. Moreover, our model serves as a valuable reference for designing complete models for other 
animals. In this era of exponential growth in experimental data, these complete models will enable 
us to gain a deeper understanding of the neural computation that underlies specific behaviors.

Fig 1. Overview of MetaWorm. 
MetaWorm comprises two sub -models: the neural network model and the body & environment 
model. The neural network model is a biophysically  detailed. Its neuron models are multi -
compartmental, exhibiting electrophysiological features similar to real C. elegans  neurons. These 
neuron models are connected by synapses and gap junctions on neurites. An optimization tool is 
employed to tune the weights and polarities of these connections. The body & environment model 
consists of a biomechanical body, a 3D fluid environment and a real-time simulation engine. The 
soft body is constructed using 3341 tetrahedrons, with 96 muscles arranged from head to tail as 
actuators. The large-scale 3D environment allows for the integration of various agents and 
elements including C. elegans, E. coli (food), and fluid. And it provides  a range of auxiliary tools 
for dynamic lighting, visualization, tracking, and behavior analysis. Real-time simulation is 
achieved through a Finite Element Method (FEM) solver and simplified hydrodynamics. To 
achieve foraging behavior in C. elegans, the neural network senses attractor’s concentration in the 
environment, performs neural computations to control muscle s’ contraction and relaxation, and 
ultimately deforms the body to propel it towards the attractor.

Methods 
1 Details of Neural Network Model 
1.1 Neuron models 
Neurons were modeled by morphologically derived multi-compartmental models with 
somatic Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics1 and passive neurites. These neuron models captured both 
the biophysical properties and spatial complexity of neurons. The models integrated three 
kinds of neuron data: ion channel, morphology, and electrophysiology.  
Ion channel models were determined according to published studies2. There were 14 ion 
channels divided into 4 categories: voltage-gated potassium channels (SHK-1, EGL-36, SHL-
1, KVS-1, KQT-3, EGL-2, IRK1/3), calcium-regulated potassium channels (SLO1, SLO2, 
KCNL), voltage- gated calcium channels (EGL19, UNC2, CCA1), and passive sodium 
channel (NCA). Model equations and parameters for ion channels are given in Supplementary 
Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2. 
As for morphologies of neuron models, the spatial structures were adopted from the C. 
elegans neuronal anatomy models created by the Virtual Worm Project3 and the OpenWorm 
Project4. Each neuron model had a soma section and several neurite sections. Neurite sections 
were further divided into several compartments, each of which was shorter than 2 μm. 
Only soma compartment had active i on currents. Soma compartments and neurite 
compartments shared the same passive properties. To identify the passive and active 
parameters of neuron models, a deep learning tool5, was used to fine-tune these parameters to 
reproduce experimental data of voltage /current clamp. The value of the parameters can be 
found in Supplement Table S3. 
Less than 20% of the C. elegans  neurons have been recorded for the desired 
electrophysiology data. To estimate model parameters for those neurons that were not 
recorded, a method was implemented to generalize parameter values. First, considering the 
available data and hierarchy of information flow in C. elegans nervous system6,7, the neurons 
were divided into 5 functional groups (sensory neuron, interneuron, command interneuron, 
head motor neuron, and body motor neuron, see Supplement Table S4). Second, 5 neurons of 
each functional group (AWA8, AIY8, AVA9, RIM8, and VD510) were selected and their model 
parameters were optimized as described above. These parameter values of optimized neuron 
models were then generalized to other neuron models according to their functional categories. 
In other words, neuron models in the same functional group share identical electrical 
parameters. Each neuron models have their own morphologies yet similar electrical properties 
to those neurons in the same functional group. 
1.2 Graded synapse and gap junction models 
The neuron models were connected by graded synapses8,11 and gap junctions12 in C. elegans 
neural network. Graded synapses, include excitatory and inhibitory synapses, were modeled 
according to published C. elegans  models 4,13,14. The synaptic conductance is continuously 
changed with presynaptic membrane potential. Postsynaptic current is given by:

p junctions were modeled as simple resistances, where current flowing from presynaptic

𝐼𝐼 = −𝑤𝑤�𝑉𝑉pre − 𝑉𝑉� 
where 𝑤𝑤 is the conductance of gap junction. 
The parameter values of these synapses were set according to published models12: the 
conductance of the synapses and gap junctions had the same order of magnitude of 1e-4 μS. 
The specific weight of each synaptic connection in a specific neural network can be set 
randomly or be optimized according to a target, as described in Method 1.4. 
1.3 Connection locations 
Detailed neuron connections in the neural network model were located on the neuronal 
neurite (axons or dendrites) of the neurons, which were based on the neuron connectivity 
matrices and a neurite connectivity algorithm. 
The neuron connectivity matrices were acquired from published connectome data6,15. The 
original data in the matrices was the total number of electron microscopy (EM) series of all 
synapses (or gap junctions) between two neurons. In our work, the number of EM series was 
transformed into the number of synapses (or gap junctions) by: 
𝑁𝑁 = 𝑎𝑎 ∙ tanh(𝑏𝑏 ∙ 𝐶𝐶) 
where 𝐶𝐶  is the number of EM series, 𝑎𝑎  and 𝑏𝑏  are constants. For synapses number 
transformation, 𝑎𝑎 = 23.91,𝑏𝑏 = 0.02285, while for gap junction, 𝑎𝑎 = 20.49, 𝑏𝑏 = 0.02184. 
These parameters were inferred from partial-animal connectome data6. 
After the number of synapses (or gap junctions) was determined, the locations of synapses 
(or gap junction) on neural neurites were identified by a connection algorithm. The algorithm 
was based on the rule that distances between the centroid coordinates of possible presynaptic 
and postsynaptic neurites follow a certain statistical distribution16. We fitted synapse and gap 
junction distribution by two Inverse Gaussian distributions: 
𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥, 𝜇𝜇) = 1
𝑘𝑘 ∙ √2𝜋𝜋𝑥𝑥3 exp �− (𝑥𝑥 − 𝜇𝜇)2
2𝑥𝑥𝜇𝜇2 � 
where 𝜇𝜇 = 0.44, 𝑘𝑘  = 0.63 for synapse distribution, 𝜇𝜇 = 0.70, 𝑘𝑘 = 0.40 for gap junction 
distribution. The algorithm of generating connection locations was designed:

Our neural network model consists of 136 neurons, including 15 sensory neurons for inputs 
and 80 motor neurons for outputs (Supplement Table S5). Here are the reasons why we chose 
these neurons. First, 65 head ganglia neurons, whose neural dynamics were recorded in the 
published whole- brain Ca2+ imaging experiment 17 should be selected to enable the 
comparison between experiment and simulation. Second, other 71 neurons, most of which 
were motor neurons in the locomotion circuit of C. elegans7,18, were added to the network so 
that the model could be complete in a sensory-motor functional structure. In summary, this 
model contained neurons for chemosensory, decision, and locomotion. 
1.5 Connection parameters optimization 
The weights of synapses and gap junctions in the neural network was initialized randomly. 
The polarities of synapses were initialized randomly according to a given 
excitatory/inhibitory ratio (2.33). These parameters were optimized using an unpublished 
optimization algorithm for multi-compartment neural network. The algorithm employed a 
mathematical approximation approach to calculate gradients for Back Propagation Through 
Time (BPTT) to update parameters. Except for the weights (of synapses and gap junctions) 
and the polarities (of synapses), the inputs (of some sensory neurons) also can be optimized 
by this optimization algorithm. 
1.6 PCA of neural activities 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the time series data of soma membrane 
potential of the 65 head neurons. Before conducting the analysis, the time series data was 
preprocessed by subtracting the mean value of the trace. 
1.7 Correlation analysis  
The correlation between two neurons was quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient 
of their neural activities, which ranged from -1 to 1. A coefficient of -1 or 1 indicates a strong 
negative or positive correlation of neural activity, respectively. A coefficient of 0 indicates 
that the neural activities of the two neurons are unrelated. In this analysis, the neural activity 
was represented by the membrane potential of soma. 
2 Details of Body & Environment Model 
2.1 The body model 
Tetrahedron is the simplest ordinary convex polyhedra in three-dimensional space. It has 
four vertices, six edges, and is bounded by four triangular faces. We used tetrahedron as the 
basic element to construct the body model. Surface shape of the body was extracted as 
triangle list from Sibernetic’ membrane data19. Then we triangulated the body with a robust 
and high-quality algorithm20. The triangulated tetrahedron mesh was refined for latter 
mechanics solver. The final body mesh was in a straight, natural resting pose that we defined 
as the standard body (Fig.6A). The triangulated tetrahedron body was not strictly symmetric 
in dorsal-ventral direction and left-right direction. Since triangulation algorithm had 
additional constraints on quality of tetrahedrons. This non-strict symmetry is probably more 
consistent with real C. elegans. 
2.2 Muscles 
96
 muscles were arranged from head to tail according to C. elegans  anatomy. Each 24 
muscles were grouped into longitudinal string, marked as ventral right (VR), ventral left 
(VL), dorsal right (DR), dorsal left (DL) in four quadrants (Fig.6B)19. We imported body 
membrane mesh into blender21 and modeled VR, VL, DR, DL by four Bezier curves. Then

muscle geometry was exported as wavefront obj file. We used Finite Element Method (FEM) 
to simulate the soft body, and used finite element constraints to simulate elastic muscle cells 
of body. Each muscle cell (Fig.6A) corresponds to one or more FEM constraints according to 
the discretized tetrahedron body (Fig.6C). Only nearby tetrahedrons can be driven by 
corresponding muscle cells.  
2.3 Soft body solver  
We used projective dynamics22 as the solver of the soft body. The purpose of mechanics 
solver is calculating positions and velocities of all 3D vertices of the deformed body over 
time. Key idea of projective dynamics is to compute a local step and a global step iteratively. 
At local step, vertex positions of the body are fixed and projection variables are updated. At 
global step, projections are fixed and vertex positions of the body are updated. The local step 
is well suited for parallelism, thus can be optimized for performance. The global step is a 
linear system and can be precomputed if the body geometry and constraints are not changed. 
After a few local-global iterations the vertex positions of deformed body are converged. Then 
velocity of deformed body can be computed by Euler integration.  
2.4 Interaction with environment 
A simplified model of hydrodynamics was used to simulate the interaction between the 
body and the fluid, similar to the published study 23. For simplicity, we supposed external 
force is only formed at the surface of body. Two kinds of external forces were considered 
here: thrust force offered by body movement, and drag force offered by fluid. With this 
simplification, computation in the whole 3D fluid environment is avoided. Thus, more agents, 
larger environments, more complex tasks are achievable through this simplification. 
2.5 Numerical stable coordinate system for body movement 
C. elegans  is a soft body animal which has special patterns during movement. Every 
position of the body is oscillating during movement. Moreover, there is no apparent important 
marks on the body during locomotion, therefore it’s hard to find an apparent stable coordinate 
system for C. elegans movement. Simply using head or body center as a coordinate system 
can’t analysis the body’s movement quantitatively and stably. Here we proposed an effective 
and simple method to measure C. elegans locomotion. The core of our method is to find a 
numerically stable coordinate system relative to the body itself. The main steps of our method 
are as follows:  
1) Define the target body, standard body and standard body coordinate system (SBCS).  
2) Obtain transformation between the target body and the standard body. 
3) Use the transformation in 2) to perform three-dimensional transformation on the SBCS to 
obtain the target body reference coordinate system (TBRCS). 
Details of the three steps are described below: 
Step 1) The target body is the research subjects. It can change its shape over time and 
exhibits various behaviors. The standard body is a special case of the target body. Here we 
define the standard body in a natural state where the head and tail are in a straight line, 
without stretching and bending. There is no internal force in the standard body soft body, and 
no external force acting on the standard body surface. The S BCS is a three-dimensional 
orthogonal coordinate system used to reflect the overall structure and function of the standard 
body. In this case, we define the SBCS with origin at the standard body center. X-axis of the 
SBCS is towards the head of the standard body. Z- axis of the S BCS is towards ventral to

dorsal direction of the standard body. Three axes of the SBCS form a right-handed coordinate 
system. Schematic diagram of the target body, the standard body and the SBCS can been seen 
in Figure. 7A. 
Step 2) In this step, we first define the corresponding matching points on the target body 
and the standard body. For example, simply use all the vertices of the body. The 
transformation between the matching points on the target body and the standard body is 
calculated as the transformation between the target body and the standard body. Calculation 
formulas of the transformation are as follows: 
𝑝𝑝0��� = 1
𝑚𝑚 � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
0
𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖=1
 
𝑝𝑝̅ = 1
𝑚𝑚 � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖=1
 
𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖
0 = 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
0 − 𝑝𝑝0��� 
𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 = 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 − 𝑝𝑝̅ 
𝐻𝐻 = 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖
0𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇 
𝑅𝑅 = 𝑉𝑉𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 
𝑇𝑇 = 𝑝𝑝̅ − 𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝 0��� 
𝑀𝑀 = �𝑅𝑅 𝑇𝑇
0 1 � 
The matching points are represented by column vectors. 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
0  are matching points on the 
standard body, and 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 are matching points on the target body . m is the number of matching 
points. 𝑝𝑝0��� is the center point of matching points on the standard body , and 𝑝𝑝̅ is the center 
point of matching points on the standard body. 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖
0 refers to the standard body matching points 
with the center offset subtracted, and 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 denotes the standard body matching points with the 
center offset subtracted. 𝐻𝐻  is a matrix computed by 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖
0𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇 . 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇  is transpose of 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 , 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 =
[𝑞𝑞1, 𝑞𝑞2 … 𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚], 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖
0 = [𝑞𝑞1
0, 𝑞𝑞2
0 … 𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚0 ]. 𝑈𝑈 and 𝑉𝑉  are obtained by the singular value decomposition 
𝐻𝐻 = 𝑈𝑈Λ𝑉𝑉 of the matrix  𝐻𝐻. 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 is transpose of 𝑈𝑈. 𝑀𝑀 is the transformation matrix between the 
target body and the standard body, which will be used in next step. 𝑅𝑅 is rotation part of 𝑀𝑀, 𝑇𝑇 
is translation part of 𝑀𝑀. A schematic diagram of matching points and transformation 𝑀𝑀 are 
shown in Fig. 7A. 
Step 3) In this step, we use matrix 𝑀𝑀 to perform three -dimensional transformation on the 
SBCS to obtain the TBRCS . The matrix of the TBRCS can be formulated as: 𝑀𝑀� = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀0 =
�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅0 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇0 + 𝑇𝑇
0 1 � . 𝑀𝑀 = �𝑅𝑅 𝑇𝑇
0 1 � ,  𝑅𝑅  and 𝑇𝑇  have been described in last section. 𝑀𝑀0 =
�𝑅𝑅0 𝑇𝑇0
0 1 � is matrix used to represent the S BCS. 𝑇𝑇0  is the origin of the S BCS, and 𝑅𝑅0 
indicates orientation of the S BCS. The column vector of 𝑅𝑅0  represents the orthogonal 
coordinate axis. Finally, we can make the TBRCS through 𝑀𝑀�: 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇0 + 𝑇𝑇 as the origin and 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅0 
as the orthogonal coordinate axis.  
2.6 Numerically stable measurements of body movement 
1) Measurement of body trajectory 
During behavior analysis, C. elegans  can be seen as a deformable biology composed of

multiple points. When studying the locomotion of a deformable body, generally one or more 
points of biology body is defined as tracking object, and locomotion of deformable body is 
studied through tracking these defined points. For deformable biology like C. elegans , 
position and velocity of local tracking points are hard to reflect overall state of body 
locomotion (Fig. 7C). As a result, values such as body  trajectory or steering angle obtained 
through these tracking points are usually unstable over time. Using the TBRCS, we can better 
describe the overall trend of body movement. Comparison of trajectories are shown in Figure. 
7A. If the center point of body is used as trajectory, the trajectory is a zigzag shape. However, 
if the TBRCS is used as trajectory of body movement, the trajectory is a smooth curve which 
means stable values. It can be seen the TBRCS  is more suitable as a measurement of overall 
path and direction of body locomotion. 
2) Tracking body movement 
H
ere, we demonstrate how to track body movement with the TBRCS. If the standard body 
is drawn in the TBRCS , then it can be used as a reference for the target body . The standard 
body and the target body will be center alignment, translate and rotate together. We define 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘
0 
as 3D tracking points of the standard body , and 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘 as 3D tracking points of the target body. 
k = 1, 2 … n. n is the number of tracking point. Then relative movement of body can be 
defined as 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘
0. It’s a measurement of body locomotion relative to itself (the standard 
body), which is more numerically stable than relative to world. 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘 − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘
0 is also better than 
relative to body center, since both translation part and rotation part of whole deformation 
body are considered in the TBRCS. Moreover, sampling bias of tracking points is eliminated 
through subtract operation, since bias minus bias equals zero. 
In
 Figure 7B, we sampled 17 tracking points on the body uniformly. Offset of the tracking 
points are indicated by pink lines between tracking points. Relative velocity of 3D tracking 
points is drawn in blue arrows. As a common method, trajectories of sampled 17 tracking 
points that relate to world are also shown in Fig ure 7C. We can see that compared to all 17 
tracking points trajectories, trajectory of the TBRCS  is the smoothest. Relative position and 
relative velocity of 3D tracking points over time are plotted in Figure 7 E and Fig ure 7 F 
respectively. In Figure 7E, Positions of 3D tracking points are tiled from bottom to top for 
clear seeing. In this case, swing direction (Z direction of the TBRCS ) of swimming body can 
be clearly reflected with the TBRCS . We can also find that there is a spring movement in X 
direction of the TBRCS (tail to head) during forward swimming. Locomotion in Y direction 
of the TBRCS is nearly flat since in this case muscle activations are approximately 
symmetrical in this direction. From Fig ure 7 F we can further deduced that the biggest 
propulsion of forward swimming is come from tail (purple line), since speed means power. 
3) Steering angle of body movement 
If 𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖   is the trajectory of TBRCS origin at time 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 =  𝑑𝑑1, 𝑑𝑑2 … 𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚 . Then we can get 
velocity of TBRCS  by 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 =
𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖−𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖−1
𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖−𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖−1
. In this way, velocity magnitude and velocity direction 
over time are numerically stable. We used angle θ which is between TBRCS x-axis and 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 as 
a measurement of steering, as shown in Fig ure 7D. Both 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 and the TBRCS  are numerically 
stable over time, thus θ is also numerically stable.

The neural network simulation was coupled with the physical body & environment 
simulation to achieve closed-loop interaction. Food was at the center of the simulated 
physical environment, acting as an attractor to the C. elegans . The food concentration was 
linearly distributed in the environment. The neural system received currents regarded as 
sensory signals. The amplitude of the currents was proportional to the gradient of food 
concentration. The outputs of the neural network controlled the movements of the body in the 
environment through a reservoir readout weight matrix (see Method 3.2). As the body moved 
in the physical environment, the distance between the body and the food changed, causing the 
food concentration gradient updated and transformed to currents injected into the soma of 
sensory neurons. 
During the interaction of the two sub-models, the simulation time step of the neural network 
was 5/3 ms and that of physical environment simulation was 100 ms. The two systems 
synchronized every 100 ms to update the sensory signals and muscle forces. 
3.2 Reservoir configuration 
To establish the neuron- muscle connection between the neural system and physical body 
muscles, a reservoir computing framework was used. The neural network model acted as the 
non-linear reservoir. The membrane potentials of 80 motor neurons (Supplement Table S5) 
were linearly combined and mapped to 96 muscle forces via an 80 by 96 matrix.  
The r eservoir  was trained using data extracted from a 10-second movement generated in the 
simulated physical environment. The pairs of food concentration and muscle force during the 
movements were used as inputs to the neural network and target outputs of the readout layer, 
respectively. Only the reservoir readout matrix was optimized, while the parameters in the 
neural network model was fixed. 
4 User-friendly Interfaces 
The neural network model consists of ion channel, neuron, and network connection 
modules. The parameter and algorithm settings of each module can be modified 
independently. Parameters were saved in JSON files that are easy to read and modify.
